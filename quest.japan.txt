1559	<title name="NONE" />（I hand Elen 2 Gold Ores）<p/>So, did you think that was pretty tough?<p/>Recently because of the monsters, no one has been going in the dungeon.<br/>There is a person who Comgan asks to go mining, but...<br/>I am a little worried if the situation continues...<p/>It would be safer if someone would regularly go mining.<br/>Ah! I talk too much!<p/>
1560	Defeat Giant White Wolf
1561	It is Deian from Tir Chonaill. There is a giant white wolf that sometimes appears in Tir Chonaill's pasture. It is attacking the sheep and I cannot protect them. Could you please come and defeat the giant white wolf?
1562	Speak with Deian
1563	Eliminate the Giant White Wolf
1564	Speak with Deian
1565	Hey, <username/>!  I was waiting for you!<p/>Have you heard of the gigantic white wolf appearing in Tir Chonaill?<br/>Occasionally, it appears where the other wolves are, and then attacks the sheep.<p/>When they appear, they cause so much damage.<p/>Please eliminate the giant white wolf for me.<br/>I will give you a reward if you get rid of it for me.<p/>When you want to know the place and time where they appear,<br/>just ask about "Nearby Rumors" from the local villagers in Tir Chonaill.<br/>I can tell you occasionally.<p/>Well then, good luck!<p/>
1566	
1567	You really helped me out.<p/>I was so worried about the sheep.<br/>Thank you!<p/>

1574	Secret of the Snowman
1575	You will find the road to Sidhe Sneachta on the way to Alby Dungeon, north of town. An earring was lost while making a snowman. Can you look for it? - Duncan -
1576	Deliver the lost earring to Duncan.
1577	Well done.<p/>It must have been difficult finding the earring on the snowy slopes of Sidhe Sneachta,<br/>but somehow you found it.<p/>Hmm...actually, this favor was for someone else.<br/>He said he thought he accidently misplaced the arring in a snowman he was building<br/>and he asked me to help him find it.<p/><image name='G1_Ch01_sidhesnechta'/>If you head toward Sidhe Sneachta, I heard there is a strange structure there.<br/>He said he made the snowman in remembrance of seeing that building...<p/>They say the structure is <br/>connected to another place by some magical power...<br/>But it doesn't seem like just anyone can enter...<p/>There are alot of rumors surrounding this place,<br/>There's a story about a Druid who lost his family<br/>and couldn't overcome the sorrow...and he turned into a bear.<p/><image name='G1_Ch01_manaherb'/>...They say the bear is gathering Mana Herbs. <br/>If you happen to meet the bear I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea to give it some Mana Herbs as a gift.<p/>Mana Herbs are normally found inside dungeons, <br/>but if you're not confident enough to go explore dungeons, you can always buy some from people. <br/>Nature is so mysterious...how does an herb that produces artificial Mana grow in a place without any moonlight...?<br/>Nature is truly magical...<p/>Well, in order to go north you must reach level 10 or higher first.<br/>I happen to have some Mana Herb. Take this with you.<p/>

Of course.<br/>I'm not surprised...<br/>He doesn't let anyone into his life...<p/>He said he couldn't accept me<br/>because he was living the life of a Druid<p/>...<p/>...Am I nothing more than a tool who understands the Fomor language to him...?<p/>...I'm sorry, but you will need to go back to where he is...<p/>I would like to give the book to him myself.<br/>Please understand why I can't give this book to you.
1592	<title name='NONE'/>（Tarlach listens intently as you relay Kristell's message to him.）<p/>...<br/>Is that what she said...?<br/>But, I cannot leave here.<p/>I understand how she feels, since<br/>she gave up her life as a Fomor...for love...<br/>but I'm not a man who deserves that kind of love...<p/>...Although it was too late when I realized it... and ending up breaking her heart...<p/>...<p/>Could I ask you a favor...?<br/>...I left something with Meven of Tir Chonaill a long time ago.<br/>Would you please retrieve it for me...?<p/>Just go and tell him what I told you<br/>and he will know what you're talking about.
1593	Oh, it's you, <username/> Hello.<p/><title name='NONE'/>（You tell Meven abot Tarlach's item.）<p/>Even if it was Druid magic,<br/>it didn't last this long.<br/>So I was taking care of it through Lassar.<p/>Anyway,<br/>Tarlach still must have not forgotten about her<br/>if he's asking for that item back...<br/>Well, it's really just too sad...<p/>It doesn't mean I will give up.<br/>I will tell Lassar about this matter,<br/>Could you tell me once more about the book...?<br/>Lassar is one of the top experts.<p/>After the current request, meet with Kristell,<br/>She can clear up the contents of the book you received.<br/>...Lassar asked you directly.<br/>Please tell me.<p/>...to get it back...<br/>She seems to be unable to forget Tarlach...<br/>It doesn't matter.

1599	Meet with Aeira
1600	Thank you for sharing the story of my mentor with me, <username/>...<p/>...<p/>Um.. are you telling me that Chief Duncan of Tir Chonaill<br/>wants to... borow the master's book...?<p/>...<p/>... I guess it should be okay.<p/>He is a wise old man who has been through a lot, and<br/>he may be able to catch some things that we may have missed...<p/>Please give this copy to the Chief for me... <p/>
1601	So this is the Book of Revenge that Mores wrote...<br/>Let me take a look at it.<p/>（Duncan skims through the book.）<p/>Hmm...interesting.<br/>I see. Hmm.<br/>Mmm...<p/>...? Is this the end...?<br/>That can't be...<p/>…。<p/><username/>, it doesnt' seem like the book ends here.<br/>Judging by the book's writing style and structure, it seems like ther should be more to it.<br/>Looking at the introduction of the book, it seems like a 3 part series...<p/>It's hard to comment on the Goddess's intentions<br/>just from this part of the book.<br/>Could you find out if there is another book...?<p/>If we can get a hold of the other volumes,<br/>we will be able to figure out how to best respond to Mores and the Goddess,<br/>and waht exactly to say to the King of Aliech.<p/>I am sure you are aware of this, as well...<br/>that it's difficult to get the attention of the King and the lords<br/>with something as vague as this...<p/>I don't know where you found the translation of this book...<br/>but please inquire about the existence of the next volume. Thank you. <p/>
1602	Is there another volume to this book...?<br/>I'm not sure.<br/>Based on the introduction, it seems likely...<p/>I've learned that this book is very popular amongst high-ranking Fomors.<br/>I only found that out while I was translating the book.<p/>Sorry I'm not much help.<br/>Maybe Aeira knows something about this.<br/>When it comes to books, no one's more knowledgeable than her.<p/>
1603	Hello, are you looking for a book?<br/>'The Book of Revenge'...?<br/>I don't think we have a book by that title.<br/>Trust me, I know all the books we carry here...<p/>It's a 3-volume set? If you've already gotten the first<br/>volume, then I can't sell it to you as a set, either...<br/>I doubt they'll let me order each volume seperately.<p/>It's written in the Fomor language?!<br/>I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere for that.<br/>It's going to be hard for a human bookseller to get such<br/>a book, don't you think?<p/><username/> was it?<br/>You have quite a unique taste in books...<p/>You've piqued my interest, and I know<br/>a number of explorers and scholars. I'll ask around.<br/>If I hear anything, I'll get in touch with you. <p/>

1605	I found out how to get the Book of Revenge Volume II. Please come by the Dunbarton Bookstore. - Aeira -

1607	Ah! <username/>Welcome!<p/>Do you remember the book I gave you before, 'Land of Eternity, Tir Na Nog"?<br/>The auth of that book, Leslie, called.<br/>You see, Leslie is a famouse historian and an avid explorer.<p/><image name='G1_Ch21_memo'/>She sent me this note.<br/>It says that she once saw 'The Book of Revenge' inside Ciar dungeon, written in Fomor language. <br/>She said if you offer this note on the altar of Ciar Dungeon, you'll be transported to where you can find the book.<br/>...Apparently this note has some kind of magic on it or something...<p/>And...here, this is Aeira's special gift to you, the Red Wing of the Goddess! <br/>I will give you the note and the Red Wing of the Goddess!<br/>I wish you the best of luck!<p/>Oh, and if you happen to lose the note,<br/>Come see me again. <p/>

1613	Ask Aeira Where the Third Volume Is
1614	You must be here for your translated copy of the book.<br/>Here, I think you should read it yourself.<p/>That said, I can't believe what's written in this book...<p/>
1615	Good job.<br/>You not only found the book but even got it translated...<br/>Here, let me see it.<p/><title name="NONE"/>（Duncan starts reading the book.）<p/>Hmm... Hah...<p/>So, it's true.<br/>So that's why the Fomor Scroll was made.<p/>The Fomors... recognized that humas and nature<br/>were becoming seperated...<p/>At this point, I think you'll have to find the last volume of the book.<br/>If what I think is true, all of their plans will be in that book. <br/>Ever since the Mag Tuireadh war, <br/>Fomors have been preparing for another war.<p/>We don't know anything for sure yet, but <br/>if we don't find their plan and prevent it, <br/>Erinn might be destroyed...<p/>We have to find the 3rd volume. <br/>Please... You have to find the last book of the Fomors.<p/>...<p/>And don't forget that<br/>you must not tell anyone<br/>about these things regarding the Goddess.<p/>
1616	Since you're looking for volume 3, I'm guess you already<br/>found volume 2? I'm afraid I haven't heard anything about <br/>volume 3 just yet.<p/>It's turning out to be a lot harder to find the last volume.<br/>My distributor has been absolutely useless, and Eavan says <br/>she hasn't come across such a book. Even Leslie says she <br/>doesn't know anything. Same with Stewart.<p/>I've asked everywhere, but I don't know how long it will take.<br/>I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. But even if <br/>you're patient, I just don't have any confidence that I'll<br/>be able to find it...<p/>
1617	Find Book of Revenge Volume III
1618	I heard about the Book of Revenge, Vol. III. Come to the Dunbarton Bookstore immediately. - Aeira -

1620	Ask Lassar in Tir Chonaill for the book.
1621	Meet Seumas at the Dragon Ruins to ask him about the book.
1622	Ah! I've been waiting!<br/>I have good news.<p/>I found out where you can find volume III<br/>of that Fomor book you've been looking for.<br/>Lassar, the magic instructor at the school in<br/>Tir Chonaill has it. You know her, don't you?<p/>She came by looking for a particular book recently,<br/>and while we were chatting, I snuck in a question<br/>about your own search. She says she has the third<br/>volume of "The Book of Revenge"! An original copy<br/>in the Fomor language, no less!<p/>You should hurry up and see her. Good luck!<p/>
1623	Welcome. You must be...<username/>?<p/>...So it was you who was looking for the book.<br/>Aeira had asked me about the book before.<br/>Did she tell you what I told her...?<image name='G1_Ch23_seumas'/>Yes, the book isn't actually mine.<br/>It belongs to Seumas, who works at the ruins excavation site in Gairech.<p/><image name='G1_Ch23_seumas'/>He said he found it not too long ago while excavating the site.<br/>But he could not read the writing<br/>and asked around and came to me to interpret it.<p/>But... it was too difficult for me as well.<br/>Forget translating... I couldn't even read one sentence of it.<br/>I was barely able to figure out the title.<p/>When I told Seumas, he said it was okay, and asked me to return his book, so <br/>as a matter of fact, I just gave the book back to him.<p/>I don't know if you'll be able to read it because it's such a difficult book to read...<br/>but if you want to take a look at it, stop by the...<br/>ruins excavation site in Gairech.<p/>I'm sure Seumas will be happy to find out <br/>if there is indeed a way the book can be translated.<p/>
1624	(He gasps for breath as he speaks.)<br/>Ah... I suppose you're the one Lassar mentioned...?<br/>You need the...book of Fomors...?<p/>Not too long ago...I asked Lassar...<br/>to translate it...but she said she couldn't do it...<p/>I probably won't be able to figure it out myself anyway...<p/>Here...is the...book...<br/>Hope it would be helpful...<p/>

Nobody but your party can help you<br/>in here.<br/>Even if your life ends and you pass away...<p/>When you can't move<br/>You return to your world.<br/>I do think you have to endure that fact, only because you are a human of another world...<p/>...I've called you because a good plan has come up.<p/>Do you.. know about the added soul phenomenon?<br/>It is the phenomenon where the spirit doesn't go away from one's body...<br/>I thought maybe if you were to use this trick<br/>you could let your spirit stay near here.<p/>Yes... if your spirit does not go away from your fallen body and stays near it<br/>there wouldn't be such a thing as having to resurrect back from the world you were in<br/>even if you were to lose the freedom of your body.<p/>But... dealing with spirits is also a dangerous thing...<br/>With the slightest provocation you can turn into one of those zombies behind the graveyard...<p/>...So, I'll have to see if my thoughts are correct.<br/>If you knock down the spiritless zombies<br/>I will measure the added soul phenomenon that happens around the zombies<br/>and see if you can resurrect in this place.<p/>What do you think? Would you like to give it a try?<p/>
1640	
1641	It's just as I'd thought. We can use the added soul phenomenon<br/>and have your spirit stay here.<br/>If you believe me, from now on,<br/>you won't ever be an undead even if you collapse here.<p/>...Yes. My body and soul<br/>are exchanging with you the amount of strength<br/>you need to resurrect here...<p/>Oh no... Are you uncomfortable about exchanging such things with me?<br/>Ha ha, no need to act calm.<br/>But...<p/>Even when you can't move<br/>you can come near me.<br/>You will make it through this world with more ease if you remember this.<p/>

1873	I heard that someone considers me their idea suddenly,<br/>That's right... I wonder if that person is you...<p/>...<p/>Well, that was a joke.<br/>There is a woman at Ceo Island who was really beautiful.<br/>I have never seen such a beautiful woman before.<p/>Her name is Aer.<p/>She is not a human.<br/>Aer is my ideal type.<p/>...<p/>Why did you ask me about this?

1882	Deliver the book to Redire
1883	Well you made it,<username/>.<br/>I need your help.<br/>First of all, look at this.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire hands you an item)<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>This is an item from a helper within the church.<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Esras is secretly communicating with someone<br/>It may look like a regular book, but it's actually a Letter Box.<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Unfortunately, I can't make out exactly what is being said.<br/>They really didn't make any sense...<br/>and some didn't even have the recipient's name on them...<br/>Based on the letter's envelopes along with the recods that were kept for every letter that was sent...<br/>It looks as though the letters were mainly exchanges between someone named Colbha and herself...<p/>Even after an extensive search, however, we couldnt' find anyone in Emain Macha with that particular name.<p/>It seemed a bit suspicious, so I'm just holding on to the letters for now.<br/>After looking closely, though... we realized... that it may have been overwritten in magic,<p/>Unfortunately, I canot solve the magic.<br/>However, if you are familiar with magic, you might be able to solve it.<p/><image name='g2_Ch29_lassar'/>It is too dangerous to ask the people of Emain Macha...<p/>So, I'd like to ask someone who lives in another area,<br/>Apparently there is a woman named Lassar from Tir Chonaill<br/>She is very familiar with magic.<br/>I would like to see if she could solve the magic on this letter.<p/>I cannot take it to her.<br/>Could I depend on you to take this to her<br/>to help me solve the magic?<p/>I can only depend on you...
1884	Oh, do you have something to ask me?<p/><title name='NONE'/>(I showed Lassar the letter from Redire.)<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Well, certainly there is something magical about this.<br/>It's a spell that hides the letter from the paper and replaces it with other, random letters...<p/>Would you like me to solve the magic on this letter?<p/>...<p/>Well...<p/>...<p/>...<p/>Since you're the one asking,<br/><username/>I'll do it for you.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(Lassar draws a figure on top of the letter box and begins reciting a magic spell.)<p/>...<p/>...<p/>...........<p/>.....<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook02'/>......<br/>Okay, this should do. You'll now be able to read the letter.<p/>By the way...<br/>Who's letter box is this?<br/>Is this someone else's collection of love letters?<p/>Well good luck!
1885	Hmmm? You already took care of my request...?<br/><username/>, that's incredible...<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Show me the letter at once.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(I pass the letter to Redire, and he reads it carefully.)<p/>...<p/>...So... this is how it was... AAAhhhhhh!!!<p/>I can't believe this!<br/>I can't believe I fell for their antics!<p/>...<p/>Hey, by the way... This... Something's not right.<br/>This letter box contains both the letters received AND letters sent...<p/>It's supposed to be that Esras only has the letters from Colbha, not the letters that she wrote to Colbha...?<br/>And also, after the tragedy of Emain Macha took place, the letters stop.<p/>This is just my feeling, but Colbha is probably not alive.<br/>Anyway, I'm beginning to wonder why she'd put all these in the letter box...<p/>If I were her, I'd have just thrown them away... I just can't figure it out.<br/>Surely there is something...<p/><username/>.<br/>You should ponder this information, <br/>but please don't do anything until there is definitive evidence against Esras.<p/>An owl will send you an item after a little while.<br/>Be safe until then.
1886	A Small Locked Box
1887	This small box was discovered in Esras room. However, it is locked and I cannot open it. If I try to forcefully open it the contents inside will break. I need someone to take it to Riocard in Bangor, I heard that he specializes in unlocking things like this. - Redire -

I wonder...<br/>Well, as I promised, here is the booklet from inside.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(I received a booklet from Riocard.)
1891	Oh, <username/>!<br/>I was worried, because I hadn't heard from you.<p/><image name='G2_Ch30_booklet'/>Hmm, it seems that you managed to get it opened.<br/>Well then, show me what's inside.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire reads the booklet carefully.)<p/>That should be...<br/>Laoch and I have been in contact.<br/>Now that I think about it Laoch seemed out of his mind.<br/>I have a bad feeling that something is wrong.<br/>I need to find out if Laoch is safe.<p/>I will contact you later.

I can never forgive him for what he tried to do to me...<br/>...If it wasn't for Lassar.. then...<p/>Anyway, how did you obtain this potion?<br/>It is very difficult to make...<p/>Even if you do not use it, you cannot return such a dangerous thing...<br/>I will dispose of it for you.<br/><username/>Do you understand?
1899	<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(I told Redire what Dilys told me.)<p/>What if it is marionette potion?<br/>I see...<br/>Esras must be using it to manipulate someone...<p/>As it is<username/>,<br/>What is the medicine for?<p/>...<p/>Dilys said she will dispose of it?<p/>Well, I supposed that's okay.<br/>I did not intend to use it originally.<p/>More importantly, if what the healer says is true...<p/>...<br/>Oh, it is! it is!<br/>Apparently, she seems to be right.<p/>Actually, I saw Laoch a while ago.<br/>As I said before, Laoch is my subordinate and collaborator.<p/>Indeed things have been strange with him lately...I just assumed he changed<p/>What on earth is Esras up to...?<br/><username/>,sorry but there is still more work for you to do.<p/>I will contact you when I find out more.<br/>Please be careful.

This is bad news...<br/>My sources in the castle have been disappearing one by one.<br/>Either that, or they've lost themselves like Laoch.

(He gasps.)<br/>Normally, after using those Golems...<br/>the magic on those Golems would be dispelled, but...<p/>This was a long time ago, and those Partholons<br/>used the Fire Golems at Sen Mag<br/>to beat the Fomors...<p/>The problem started from there...<br/>As you know...about those Fire Golems... (He gasps.) ...the mana that was etched into their bodies<br/>was very difficult to remove.<br/>They wreaked so much havoc...<p/>It's not as if we could destroy them ourselves...<br/>And that's when they came up with...Ceo Island... (He gasps again.)<br/>Summoning each and every one of those Golems...to a remote island...<br/>and creating that area with elements that are opposed to the Golems...effectively sealed them away from society.<p/>Yes, that means the Golems at Ceo Island are...<br/>the very Golems that fought the Fomors in Sen Mag.<br/>But for them to resume their activities now...<br/>this is definitely...an unnatural occurrence...<p/>This was caused by someone...<br/>I don't know who's responsible for this, but...<p/>I can come up with two theories behind...the reawakening of these Golems...<br/>Either there's something out there so dangerous...that those Golems at Ceo Island needed to reawaken...<p/>Or, reawakening the sealed Golems...was practice...<br/>for reawakening something even bigger...<br/>That's my theory...<p/>All magic that has to do with enabling a being to move...<br/>are based on the same theory...
1917	<username/>, did you happen to find more information? If so, then please let me know right now!<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Price listens carefully to your explanation and nods.)<p/>Hmmm...<br/>So this is what I'm getting right now...<br/>Esras is very much interested in getting her hands on ancient knowledge...<br/>and to do that, she plans on awakening Tabhartas, the key to that knowledge...<br/>and to do so, she has awakened the Golems at Ceo Island...<p/><image name='g2_Ch34_james'/>Alright, well...<br/>Since you are here and all, can you help me one more time?<br/>Do you know James from the Church of Emain Macha?<br/>Yes, the priest.<p/>He's actually an investigator sent by the Royal Court.<p/>I recently received a document from him.<br/>It was about Esras collecting enormouse amounts of gold recently.<br/>I have a feeling that whatever Esras is planning<br/>might be far more horrible than what we think it is.<p/>Go deliver the information we collected to James.<br/>Last time I saw James,<br/>he was trying really ahrd to win Craig over...<p/>I think this amount of evidence will probably be enought to do it.<p/>Go tell James what you know,<br/>and help him persuade Craig.
1918	<username/>I've been waiting on you.<br/>I've heard about Redire's story.<p/>Despite being head priest of Emain Macha,<br/>there were investigators dispatched by the Pope.<br/>And here you are, investigating allegations of Esras's tyranny...<br/>Can you tell me what you and Price have learned?<p/>Of course, we will look into what you've found on Esras.<br/>However...<p/>Esras is very powerful due to his position in the government.<br/>Emain Macha has been more prosperous because of her reign.<br/>Esras also pays her taxes,<br/>and I also began to obey her instructions.<p/>However, one cannot easily deceive the Pointiff's Court.<p/>The suspicious potions brewed in the basements of Emain Macha...<br/>The Paladin trainees who rushed to the mines in search of gold...<p/>If what you are saying is true...<p/>Esras is collecting money using the Paladins.<p/>Considering that, Gold is different from other metals, it can be used to disable magic spells.<p/>I do not know which spells Esras wants to disable,<br/>but because of how much gold Esras is gathering, it must be a powerful spell...<p/>I am very sorry, but I do not know anything else.<br/>Please don't talk to anyone else,<br/>besides Price and I about this subject.
1919	Good, I would like to see James's research.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire looks over James's Notes)<p/>I see...<p/>Is that so...<p/>Good, with this information,<br/>we should be able to prove Esras conspiracy in the Kingdom.<p/>This provides evidence.<br/>Be careful, Esras knows about our investigations and might be out to hurt you.
1920	Meet Craig
1921	Come visit with me. - Craig -
1922	Speak with Craig
1923	Actually...<p/>When the tragedy in Emain Macha happened,<br/>there was  rumor that Esras may have poisoned the Lord next in line to the throne.<p/>In addition...<p/>The lord has been in poor health lately, and it's getting worse...<br/>Esras won't let the healers near him,<p/>claiming that she will cure him personally.<p/>However, Esras was the one who helped my child.<br/>I want to believe this is all just a rumor, and leave it alone.<p/>...but I must know the truth.<p/><image name='g2_Ch35_esras'/>Go into the castle and keep Esras distracted.<br/>I will sneak past her and<br/>bring a healer to check on the lord.<p/>We cannot move against Esras until we know that the lord is safe.

There are several types of herbs. <br/><image name='bloody_herb'/> Red-coloured herbs are called [Bloody Herbs]. Bloody herbs contain ingredients that restores your health. <p/><image name='sunlight_herb'/> The yellow-coloured herbs are called [Sunlight herbs]. It contains ingredients that have the effect of restoring stamina, which makes them useful for nutritional supplements. <p/><image name='base_herb'/> The green-coloured herbs are called [Base Herbs]. It's used to stabilize combined herbs, and is by far, the most oftenly used herb. <p/><image name='G1_Ch01_manaherb'/> Blue-coloured herbs are called [Mana Herbs]. Mana herbs, on the other hand, aren't like normal herbs. It's a herb that has absorbed the mana of Eweca. Eating it by itself does nothing. <p/>Like other herbs, it is necessary to prepare it. To prepare herbs, you need a [Potion Concoction Kit]. Since we sell these kits here, why not give one a test run? Aim to become the best herbologist!

You don't have to do quests immediately. <p/>Why don't you try to explore a bit. Walk around, talk to people, explore the world... <p/>Why don't you do things you're interested in occasionally? It's nice to listen to others' requests, but it's also important to do things you enjoy. <p/>Aside from part-time jobs, and special quests, there shouldn't be any time limit on quests. There's no reason to do your quests immediately - Do you understand?

Let's drink together at another time.<br/>Instead for now, let me give you a gift. <p/>If you have time again, bring Fergus with you... Okay? And of course, keep it a secret from Lassar.

5224	...Well done. Thanks for such a comprehensive report. <p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (Tarlach reads the book again) <p/>...I see... I was kind of suspecting this, but... so Macha actually has a vendetta against humans... <p/>...While you were busy collecting information on Macha, I, too, did some research on it.<p/>...You're aware of the legend on the Advent of the Goddess, right? Yes, the legend that the moment Morrighan arrives at Erinn, it'll be transformed into a paradise. <p/>...The legend also states that even the dead will come back to life, so needless to say, lots of adventurers tried their hardest to bring Morrighan to Erinn, myself included... What people don't know... is that it's just one of the interpretations from the legend itself.<p/>There's more than one, actually. The other one states that it's actually not Morrighan, but rather... Macha... <p/><image name='G3_ch06_macha'/> The difference between the two is that... while one states that Morrighan, the Goddess of Love, descends upon Erinn and transforms Erinn into paradise, this one states that Macha, the Goddess of Destruction, descends upon Erinn and transform Erinn into a living hell. <p/>...I used to think it was simply a difference in the point of view when interpreting this legend, but... with the Statue of Goddess at the dungeon being destroyed, and the stories of the possible Second Coming of Macha being floating around... I think it's just a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. <p/>Based on the information you've given me, I have decided to delve more into the Second Coming of Macha. I'll be here researching, and if I find something significant, I'll let you know. <p/>...I don't like where this is headed... Please take care of yourself...

5235	Ohhh, you came. I have heard of your commendable work through Priest James. The reason I brought you here is because... I don't know if you heard this, but lately, the Statues of the Goddess located at various dungeons have been destroyed...  <p/>I think it's the Fomors that did it... As the word of the statues being destroyed circulated around, the appearances of the Fomors have increased greatly since. <p/>I truly believe that the Statue of the Goddess protects Erinn... That it has the power to prevent the Fomors from invading us. If the Statues are destroyed, then the horror of that devastating war from the past will soon be relived, at least that's what we think... <p/>In order to prevent that from happening, the Churches of Lymilark have all decided to join forces. We're trying to restore the destroyed Statues through the power of God. <p/>... <p/>This is what you can do for us. I want you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed, and eliminate the Fomors inside. That way, the priests won't be disturbed in their efforts to restore the Statue. <p/>The dungeons where the Statues have been destroyed are scattered everywhere around Erinn, but I want you to first head to the dungeon near Emain Macha.<p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_aodhan'/> Aodhan the head guard will lead you to the dungeon. You should go see him immediately. Here's wishing you the best of luck, and may God protect you in every step of the way, <username/>.

5237	You're back safely. Did you run into any trouble at Coil Dungeon? <p/>Next up, it's Rundal Dungeon. I'll give you the Fomor's Command sheet that was found at Rundal Dungeon, so make the dungeon pass like last time and head to the spot at the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed. <p/>Once you clear out the Fomors in that area, a priest will enter and restore the Statue of the Goddess. <p/>Making the Rundal Dungeon Pass, like last time also requires the Command sheet, as well as Holy Water of Lymilark and Mana Herb, using the Handicraft skill to piece them all together. Rundal Dungeon is a place where the cursed pirates lay trapped... Please be careful of the Skeletons, the Mimics that resemble a treasure chest, and the weapons from the pirates that have turned into monsters themselves. <p/>After finishing the restoration of the Statue at Rundal, come back and see me, and I'll have the Fomor's Command sheet ready for you for the next dungeon.<p/>Please go ahead and start now…
5238	Now there's only one dungeon left at Emain Macha, Peaca Dungeon. I'll give you the Command Sheet that was found there, so please help us out one more time.<p/>You can make Peaca Dungeon Pass by using your Handicraft skill to combine the Command Sheet I gave you, along with Holy Water of Lymilark and Mana Herb, just like last time. <p/>Peaca Dungeon is a place where the Undead appear quite frequently. It's a dungeon infamous for having the powers from Another World transferred directly to that dungeon. You've been doing great so far, but I strongly advise you to be extra careful this time around. <p/>Once the restoration is complete, please come back and report to me. <p/>Once that's complete, your mission to restore the dungeons at the Emain Macha area will be complete.<p/>...Good luck.
5239	Great, great work. Thanks to your tireless effort, the destroyed Statues of the Goddess in dungeons around the area have all been restored. <p/>Other towns have also started the restoration process, but the Fomors seem to be putting up quite a resistance. <p/>I feel that other towns will soon hear of your work, and ask for help.  If that happens, I suggest you lend your helping hand to them. <p/>...Best of luck to you.

5263	You're here. Thank you so much for coming. <p/>We were afraid this may happen soon, and as expected, the dungeons around Bangor are also going through the same fate. <p/>The number of the Statues of the Goddess destroyed has been increasing by the day. <p/> Unlike other places, Bangor does not have its own army or a fleet of guards, so the dangers we'll face if the Statues aren't restored is much bigger than other towns. <p/>...I had talked to Priest James about this matter, and he told me Wyllow, the Head Priest, have already talked to you about this. Thank goodness. <p/>I can restore the Goddess Statue no problem, but if there isn't someone that can sufficiently clear out the area from the Fomors, their forces will interrupt and affect the ritual that takes place to restore the Statues. <p/>Please help us restore the Statues at the dungeon. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_seumas'/> To get to the area where the Statues have been destroyed, please go see Seumas at the Dragon site of ruins.

Okay, now around here... there's Fiodh Dungeon... take this first.<p/><image name='G3_ch06_mherb_bpotion'/> The procedure is the same, and you can bring a friend along if you need one. It may take a little bit of time to acquire Mana Herb and the Holy Water of Lymilark... <p/>...Everyone's been out there helping restore the dungeons and the statues, so we're currently really short on Mana Herb and the Holy Water of Lymilark. I feel bad that I can't give you any right now... <p/>Just so you know, Fiodh Dungeon is full of animals that are controlled by the Fomors. Don't underestimate them just because they are some field animals... You will find yourself in grave danger. <p/>Please come back and see me once the restoration for Fiodh Dungeon is complete. I can't personally check every part of the restoration process. <p/>I appreciate it.
5266	... you are here. <p/>(gasp, gasp) great work there... Thanks to your help, the Statues of the Goddess are restored. Thank goodness... puff. <p/>But then... (gasp, gasp)... I have been hearing some news lately that ... (gasp, gasp) concerns me greatly... <p/>I hear that... someone... huff... will come and destroy it once more... (gasp, gasp) a black knight... wearing black armors... <p/>This... huff... is really not going the way we expected to go... Please... huff... be careful... Oh, and... huff... please take care of other towns, too...

As expected, we have found Statues of Goddess that have been destroyed in dungeons around Dunbarton. <p/>First, we'll need you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed and remove the Fomors in the premise. That's when myself and other priests will hold the ritual that'll restore the Statue. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_eavan'/> For more detail, please go see Eavan at the Town Office. <p/>I'll be here working on something else, so please go see her right now.

I strongly suggest you avoid the Firebolt from Hellhound at all cost. If you need help, you should also bring a friend over to help you out. <p/>Thanks in advance. Please be careful...

Thanks to your great work, all the dungeons around Dunbarton were able to restore the Statues of the Goddess. <p/>While we were busy restoring the Statues here, however, the dungeon at Emain Macha was ambushed by the Fomors, and the Paladin Knights took major hits while fending off the attack. <p/>I am also hearing that some the Statues that have already been restored are being destroyed again... <p/>Please hurry to Tir Chonaill, and restore the dungeon there. <p/>In the meantime, you should be contacted by the priest from there. <p/>Good luck.

5287	Oh you're here. Thank you for coming. Honestly, when I heard about your work through Wyllow, the Head Priest at the Church in Emain Macha, I was a bit shocked. <p/>I am not sure if other people talking about your work in great detail is necessary a good thing, but... what is true is that you are definitely becoming an important figure in our community. <p/>...Ah, wait, there's no time for small talk. As expected, we have found Statues of Goddess that have been destroyed in dungeons around Dunbarton.<p/>First, we'll need you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed and remove the Fomors in the premise. That's when myself and other priests will hold the ritual that'll restore the Statue. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_eavan'/> For more detail, please go see Eavan at the Town Office. <p/>I'll be here working on something else, so please go see her right now. Good luck.

5291	Meven's Request
5292	This is Priest Meven from the Tir Chonaill Church. We need a young warrior willing to help rebuild the Goddess Statue at the dungeon. Can you please come - Meven

5298	Ohh, I've been waiting for you. I have actually heard a lot about you... You not only rescued the Goddess, but you have also become the Knight of Light... correct? <p/>...What I want to discuss with you is about the Statues of the Goddess at dungeons being destroyed left and right. I had been deeply concerned about this when Wyllow the Head Priest suggested you as the one to contact. <p/>I hear that other towns have also been ambushed with this, and... Yes, the dungeons near Tir Chonaill also featured a number of destroyed Statues of the Goddess... <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_trefor'/> Hmmm... for more detail, you should hear it from Trefor. Priest Endelyon and I will be busy doing the restoration ritual, so... <p/>Good luck.
5299	@g3_06_DungeonRecover_Trefor
5300	Ahh, great work there. Hmmm... you took a little bit more time than I expected. Hahaha! <p/>Alright, all you have to do now is to help restore Alby Dungeon. Please take this first.<p/><title name='NONE'/><image name='G3_ch06_infiltration_Scroll'/> (Trefor hands you a Fomor Command Scroll) <p/>Everything else is the same. Use this sheet to make a pass and enter the dungeon. Once you make the way, the priests will soon follow and take care of the rest. <p/>The Fomors at Alby Dungeon are a little more than bugs and rats, but... since the Command Sheet is found, as well as the broken Statue... <p/>I think it'll be best for you to look through everything. You can never be too careful on things like this, you know. <p/>Since Alby Dungeon is literally right there, you don't need to report to me when the Statue is fully restored, okay? <p/>Keep up the good work!!

5321	I have asked you to make your way here because I have a request for you. <p/>I think you'd be... sigh... the one person that'd understand where I am coming from, so that's why I summoned all the courage I have to ask you this. <p/>I am sure you are aware of it, but... but... I... was unable to save my comrades before... and not only that... I used my injured body as an excuse... <p/>...to not even seek for them ever since. <p/>...I just couldn't look them in the eye. <p/>...I just feel so guilty at the thought of meeting with the people...  that are associated with my fallen comrades... <p/>...I don't even know if there's a sufficient way to apologize for my actions... <p/>I want to see Mari... no, Nao. Just once... that's all I need...  <p/>I just want to see her with my very own eyes, and know that she is alive and well. <p/><title name='NONE'/> (Tarlach takes something out) <p/>...and...  I...really want to tell her...that I'm sorry... for not being there for her when she needed me... <p/>... <p/>Out of all these people in Erinn... out of the ones from Tuatha Dé Danann... if you find someone that knows Nao, ...then can you please ask that person... <p/>...how...to...meet up with her...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Mari_arrow'/> ...This... is an item that Mari used to use... I don't know how much help you'll get from this, but...  I'd like for you to find out by showing this around... <p/>...please... please do this for me...
5322	<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (You tell Duncan Tarlach's story) <p/>...I had no idea he was really down on himself like that... That was probably her destiny... <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Nao'/> ...Nao is doing fine. In her mind, she does not think of this world the way Tarlach believes she feels... <p/>Mari is already the kind of being that has long surpassed the boundaries of this world... Nao can't put herself directly in contact with people in Erinn... people like me... I don't know what that's the case, but...  <p/>Only people like you that have been led here from Soul Stream... the ones that have been referred to as the people from another star... the Milletians... she can only help people like you... Us? We can't even see her... <p/>But if we're just talking about seeing her, then... I have to say there might be a way... in order to do that, I need... the... Holy Potion of Lymilark. <p/><image name='G3_ch08_s_potion'/> It's a potion... that brings the power from another world to Erinn, and expands on it... That's the only way I can see Nao... through that... <p/>...I'll teach you how to make the Holy Potion of Lymilark. Your job is to make it, and bring it to Tarlach. <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Tarlach'/> ...I'd like for you to finally alleviate some of the pain he has carried with for a long time... <p/>... <p/>...Please wait for a bit... well, I think it's finally time for you to know this. Please listen carefully... <p/>Now that some time had passed since the lord of Emain Macha passed away, ...I'll tell you a story that you might not have heard before... <p/><image name='G3_ch08_burning'/> Do you know who is responsible... for hurting Nao's father, while personally slaying her mother...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Emain_lord'/> ...It was actually the lord of Emain Macha... He was too blinded by power and greed, and... he wanted to eliminate Mores's presence from Erinn, and he wound up snatching away everything that was supposed to be for Mores.<p/>He could not accept the fact that a common folk like Mores was going to achieve more than he ever would... <p/>That's why... he did not allow Mores to enjoy what was rightfully his in his lifetime... and instead, allowed him to be glorified as the warrior that saved the world... <p/>...after his death...<p/>...I understand if you are having a hard time accepting this... but know that this is all true... If this story ever reached the lord's ears... then this small town would not have been able to survive his wrath... <p/>...That is the reason why this old man had kept his mouth shut for the longest time... <p/>...My story is over. ...Please go see Tarlach.
5323	Potion of the Soul
5324	The Holy Potion of Lymilark can be made by using the Handicraft Skill to combine [Spirit-Viewing Power], which can be obtained through the Crystal Ball at Dunbarton Library; [Spirit-Forming Bottle], which can be found inside the Rabbie dungeon, and [Spirit Hearing Water], which can be made by combining one [white herb], one [bloody herb], and one [mana herb].

I'll find out myself. <p/>...I will never, ever... forget the good deed you've done for me...
5328	James's Request
5329	I heard a story from Price. Did you know Goddess Macha is creating a dark army? I need to talk to you about something involving this, please come see me in Emain Macha.  - James
5330	Talk with James
5331	Speak with Kristell
5332	Talk with Duncan
5333	Talk with James
5334	Thank you for coming. While I was rummaging through old records, I noticed something very interesting... and I think it's something you should know. Yes... it's about Macha's resurrection. <p/>...Straight to the point, yes, she has resurrected, and is now waiting to be reawakened. <p/>... <p/>...Do you remember... how the whole tragedy of Emain Macha started in the first place...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_fomor_baby'/> ...It all started when Esras ordered Redire to kidnap a Fomor kid, causing Dark Lord to attack in hopes of rescuing the kid... <p/>... <p/>...That kid, I believe, was in fact, the reincarnated Macha. I looked through every possibility, and...  that's the only plausible explanation for this... <p/>That kid... was the key to the revival and the prospering of the Fomors... in the eyes of the Fomors,  it only makes sense that the kid not be in the hands of the humans. <p/>...The series of broken Statues are only just the beginning. The Fomors plan on reviving Macha, connect Erinn to Another World, and set this world ablaze. <p/>But then again, based on a number of signs that were shown throughout, I don't believe this kid was truly awakened into Macha. If so, then don't you think we still have a chance? <p/>...Yes, the plan is for us to stop this kid from turning into a fully-grown Macha. Either we find the kid and bring her here, or if there's an item needed for awakening, we can destroy those... <p/>...That's why I have a request for you. Please take this information I just told you, and discuss this with the Priestess of Dunbarton. <p/><image name='G3_ch13_kristell'/> ...She's very knowledgeable on Fomors, so I am sure she can give you a pointer or two on what's required for reawakening, and the measures needed to prevent this from happening.
5335	What...? You're here as a favor to Priest James? Macha's revival... and the way to stop the Goddess of Destruction from the reawakening?<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (You tell James' Story to Kristell) <p/>Okay... a child Fomor that is suspected of being Macha... I see... I can see how that works... <p/>...Now that I think of it, that story reminds me of something... a long time ago... there was an ancient spell that apparently transports a form of life into another body through a medium. <p/>...I don't know the full details of it, but... if we can find out what that medium is, and destroy it... then maybe we can prevent the transfer from happening...no? <p/>...I honestly don't know anything more about this. <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Duncan'/> If you want more details on this, then... <br/>...how about visiting the chief of Tir Chonaill? <p/>I also heard a lot about the Chief through Priest Meven. I heard that he's very experienced in life who is also very knowledgeable in that area. <p/>I am confident that the chief of Tir Chonaill... can really give you some helpful pointers on this.
5336	A form of life transferred into another body...?  And the priest of Dunbarton told you to talk to me about it...? <p/>...I think Priest Meven is spreading some incorrect information... sigh... <p/>..... <p/>The reawakening of Macha does NOT involve a live body with a different spirit transferred into it, like you said...  <p/>It's more like... a chosen body selected to be the median for the spirit of the God, and slowly becoming one with it... <p/>Of course, this process does not happen just like that... The medium used for that... the Wisdom of the Ancients... <p/>It's a set of stairs made with the power of magic by the wise men from way back, climbed up as a God-like presence... <p/> Yes... if it's used to reawaken the chosen girl into a god-like presence, then... it has to be the Wisdom of the Ancients... <p/> ...I am sure you've noticed it by now... <p/>...That's also how Nao became the way she is today...
5337	Did you manage to find out more about it? <p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (Tell him what Duncan and Meven) <p/>Wisdom of the Ancients...? A human being transformed into God...?  And that's what's required of Macha's revival...?  <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Esras'/> ...That...  ...was what Esras was looking for... <p/>..... <p/>...I feel like the pieces are finally starting to fit. The reason why Esras unearthed Tabhartas was because of the Wisdom of the Ancients... so that means... she wanted to become the God that governs the world herself...?! <p/><image name='G3_ch08_tabartas'/> I see... Tabhartas is the gatekeeper that protects the Wisdom of the Ancients...  ...If she knew how to effectively control Tabhartas, then she would have been able to find the Wisdom of the Ancients. <p/>...Okay, then... now that Tabhartas is nowhere to be found, maybe it's already at the hands of the Fomors...! <p/>...This is really not good... The exact name for Wisdom of the Ancients is... Lia Fail. <p/>...If Lia Fail ends up in the hands of the Fomors, then we must either take it back, or destroy it ourselves. Otherwise, Macha will be reawakened, and literally all hell will break loose in Erinn! <p/>Please find out where Lia Fail is located. We need to locate Lia Fail, and make sure no one else can use it. <p/>I hear that in Ceo Island, there's a Fomor that actually speaks the human language. Please ask the Fomor for directions to Lia Fail... and... please, please prevent the resurrection of Macha from happening. <p/>I will report this to the officials. Good luck.

5878	Many people are interested in the unique pattern, and it seems that there are quite a few scholars researching the pillars and patterns. <p/>Once the book is published,<br/>will there be fewer adventurers exploring and investigating the patterns? <br/>I hope not! <p/>The pillar we are looking for next is in the northeastern part of the Maiz Plains. <br/>If you go along the Nubes Mountains north of the camp,<br/>you will hit the Rutular River, and from there, go east for a while and you should find it. <p/>It's a normal three-layered pillar,<br/>so don't pass it by! <br/>You think it's too far and difficult? <br/>If you're an adventurer, you should be able to overcome difficulties like this!
5879	Pillar Featuring Human and Sun

5884	A pillar carved with a man and the sun...<br/>That pillar is the one at the entrance to Muyu Desert. <br/>This pillar has five levels, but it's fallen, so<br/>you'll need to be careful when looking for it. <p/>On the road from Maiz Plains towards Muyu Desert, take the first road and head down along Kaypi Canyon<br/>you should find it not far from the desert. <p/>Unlike the plains, the desert has many animals that will attack people, so<br/>you need to always be careful and keep an eye on your surroundings.
5885	Pillar Featuring Sun and the Season of Harvest
5886	While studying the carvings on the pillars in Iria, I noticed that there's a carving that represents the 'Harvest Season'.

5947	Studying the Giant Stone Statue
5948	One of the things I found very interesting in this book written by an explorer from Iria is about the giant stone statues. According to the book, there are statues for warriors, dignitaries, and heroes. I am looking for someone who can study those statues and send me the results. -An Archeologist from Erinn

5955	Speak with Alexina
5956	Report to Quest Board
5957	There are some interesting things written in the book about stone statues. <br/>I especially remember the ones about the statues of warriors, priests, and great men. <p/>I think the closest statue from here is a priest. <br/>If you head northeast from the camp towards the Maiz Plains, you should be able to see a large flower pattern. <p/>Nearby there are three stone statues lined up with their hands clasped in front of them. <br/>You should just sketch the one in the middle, wearing a turban. <p/>I'll check your work once you bring me the sketch.
5958	Let's see, did you find the priest statue? <br/>It's tricky to tell the statues apart, so I recommend you judge by the position of the hands and the face. <p/>Unlike the statues of priests, the statues of great men have their hands clasped behind their backs, so <br/>it's said that they are statues of high-ranking people like kings. <p/>The statue of the great man is located further northeast than the statue of the priest. <p/>Among the statues of the great man, there is one with a pointed head, so if you sketch it, I'll take a look at it. <p/>By the way, there is a part near the statue of the priest where no grass grows, did you notice it? <p/>If you look at the statue of the priest from a high place, you will see a large picture of a flower. <p/>There are other pictures painted in the vast land in Iria, so if you have time, it's worth looking for them.
5959	The rest is the statue of the warrior. <br/>The statue of the warrior is said to be located in the northern part of the Muyu Desert, across the plains. <p/>I don't know the exact location, so I can't help you any more, but according to adventurers, there is a story that the stone statues guide other statues. <p/>There seems to be a statue near the giant geoglyph,<br/>so maybe we should use the statues we've found so far as a clue to find the warrior statue.
5960	It looks like you've found the warrior statue. <br/>...I see, so the priest statue is pointing at the statue of the great man,<br/>and the statue of the great man is looking at the statue of the warrior. <p/>That might help us find the other statues. <br/>That's quite a discovery, <username/>. <p/>But my goal this time was to sketch the statue,<br/>so report your findings to the quest board. <p/>Thanks to <username/> I've gained a lot of information,<br/>so I guess this expedition can be considered a success for me too.
5961	I've summarized the information requested and reported it. <br/>The reward from Erinn's archaeologist<br/>will be sent to you by owl after the quest is completed.
5962	Studying The Legend of the Great Bird

5967	Have you ever read the book about the legend of the giant bird? <p/>At first I thought it was a fictional story, but<br/>an adventurer in Iria told me that the special ruins described in the book<br/>actually exist! <p/>It seems that at night, a glowing pattern appears<br/>on the ruins of the bird trapped in the wall, and<br/>I'd like you to sketch it for me. <p/>According to the adventurer, there are three stone statues on the north side of the desert,<br/>and if you look in the direction of the statue with a sharp head like a bird's beak,<br/>you can find it not far away.
5968	The story in the book was actually true. <br/>The information in the book matches what <br/>you, <username/>, have researched. <p/>I wonder if it's possible to revive the giant bird as described in the book! <br/>It's also worth looking into in more detail how the bird was sealed away. <p/>I will continue my research and if I need anything, I will ask you again <br/><username/>. Thank you!
5969	The legend of the giant bird, and the warrior statue
5970	A giant mark on the ground has been found that may be related to the giant bird. The mark can be found if you're heading in the direction of the middle one of the three stone statues on the desert. Please look into this for me. - Alexina
5971	Speak with Alexina
5972	Sketch the statue near the giant bird mark
5973	Speak with Alexina
5974	<username/>, you haven't forgotten about the legend of the giant bird, have you? <br/>Some adventurers have found something that may be related to the giant bird. <p/>Somewhere far in the desert, there is a picture of a giant bird drawn on the ground. <p/>This is important information, but there are also stone statues around the picture! <br/>That means! If you go along the stone statue with a sharp head like a bird's beak that faces into the desert, among the three stone statues in the desert, you may find a new stone statue. <p/>Examine the picture of the giant bird and<br/>make a sketch of the stone statue as well.
5975	Thank you for searching far and wide! <username/>. <br/>It seems that another stone statue holding a sword has been discovered. <p/>I was able to confirm the giant painting on the ground and the stone statues around it, but I'm having a hard time finding any connection to the ruins I previously investigated, where a bird was trapped in a wall that glowed at night. <p/>The story of the giant bird's resurrection is fascinating, but I think it's best to wait until I find some concrete evidence before investigating further. <p/>Rather than getting too hung up on the bird's resurrection, it might be better to look at it from a different perspective and analyze the results of my adventures so far. <p/>Thank you for researching for me again, <username/>.
5976	The Legend Behind The Snake Shrine

5982	Have you read the book "Ancient Irian Messenger of God - Snake"? <p/>According to the book, the ancient Irians<br/>believed snakes to be messengers of God and built temples to snakes. <p/>The author of the book wrote that during his adventure, somewhere in the Karu Forest,<br/>he found a picture of a snake drawn on the ground and<br/>the ruins of a temple around it. <br/>Could you find it and investigate it for me? <p/>Actually, I've never heard of anyone seeing a temple in Iria until now... <br/>I don't believe even half of what the book says. <p/><username/>If you investigate,<br/>it will become clear whether the story is true, a lie,<br/>or just a fantasy. <p/>Use the three stone statues in the desert that are heading towards the forest as a reference<br/>and find the new stone statue and the traces of the temple around it.
5983	You found a drawing of a snake on the ground. <br/>And it came with a stone statue too... <br/>This is the third stone statue holding a sword, right? <p/>But the wall ruins with the snake carved in them are quite different from what's in the book. <br/>It's just a small part of the wall,<br/>but they wrote it as if it were a temple, and even mentioned an ancient Irian<br/>god... <p/>Sometimes people report finding ruins that don't exist. <p/>It's one of the hardest parts of pioneering and exploring Iria. <br/>That's why you can't trust anything about exploration and legends. <p/>And that's why I ask <username/><br/>to look into it again and again. <br/>You understand, right? <p/><username/> Please see as many as you can<br/>and record them with your own eyes. <br/>That's the most important attitude for an adventurer. <br/>Isn't that right? <p/>Thank you so much for the accurate information this time too! <br/>Well then, I'll be in touch again next time.

5989	Speak with Alexina
5990	I was looking at all the statues that have been discovered so far, and there was one that hasn't been discovered yet. Shall we start from the beginning and put them all together? <p/>The first three statues of priests with their hands clasped in front were found in the center of the Maiz Plains,<br/>there are two statues of great men with their hands clasped behind their backs at the edge of the plains,<p/>one of the three statues in the desert, a statue of a warrior holding a sword,<br/>a statue of a warrior under the desert,<br/>a statue of a warrior discovered with the snake ruins. <p/>Yes, <username/>! Three statues with their hands clasped in front and three statues with their swords have been discovered, but one statue with its hands clasped behind its back has yet to be discovered. <p/>I looked at various documents and listened to adventurers' stories, but I couldn't find anything about the last stone statue. <p/>I thought that maybe a special kind of exploration would be necessary to find the hidden stone statues. <p/>Also, one of the last stone statues must be where the sword-wielding statue in the desert is pointing! <p/>I know it won't be easy, but <br/>I want you to find and investigate this one. <br/>Thank you, <username/>.
5991	Oho, you really did investigate the last stone statue. <br/>I thought it would take a long time, so I waited patiently. <p/>Even in an exploration that other adventurers can't easily enter, <br/><username/> you do it easily! <br/>Maybe you have a sense for exploration? <p/>Use your exploration skills to find hidden relics.<br/>At that time, exploration skills are important, but<br/>finding out where the relics are is also important!<br/>I realized that again. Right?<p/>The last stone statue you sketched<br/>was a stone statue of a great man with his hands behind his back.<br/>The picture on the ground nearby<br/>seems to be a tree.<p/>So that means we've now investigated all the mysterious<br/>stone statues and the various giant pictures on the ground, right?<p/>Maybe... if we investigate the bird and snake warrior statue and the hidden stone statue<br/>more, something else might come up.<p/>Some adventurers say the stone statues have a different meaning,<br/>and others only see meaning in the pictures on the ground...<br/>But I think the stone statues and the pictures<br/>have something in common<br/>to tell us. <p/>I think we have a long way to go before we can find out what it is, but I think it will be fun to continue this with you, <br/><username/>. <p/>Thank you for your hard work in investigating all the statues for so long! <br/>If you find any new information, please let me know right away. <br/>I look forward to it.

6003	It seems you found a stone statue with changing expressions. <br/>I found it near the forest near the Rutular River. <br/>It has 5 different expressions...<br/>That's quite a variety of expressions. <p/>So the contents of the book were true. <br/>I heard that some ruins throughout Iria<br/>have special movements... <br/>It's possible that all of those rumors are true. <p/>The more you research Iria, the more mysteries<br/>appear. <br/>I wish you continued luck.

6014	I am satisfied with the results of the investigation. <br/>The reported location and pattern were different because the condition of the offering stone<br/>has changed. <p/>I understand everything now. <br/>Thank you again <br/><username/> for such detailed investigation. <p/>Like this offering stone, more and more ruins with special behaviors are being discovered. <br/>I think we will get more information as we continue our investigation like this.

6041	It was mainly from a report left by an adventurer who explored the Muyu Desert,<br/>and it may be a coincidence, but it says that there is a deep connection between sundials and a certain structure. <p/>Far away in the direction of the shadow of the sundial in the desert, there are structures that represent time,<br/>and when the time that each symbolizes occurs, a subtle change occurs. <p/>These structures symbolize morning, noon, evening, and night, respectively. <br/>There are many reports of people seeing desert structures,<br/>but there are no accurate research results on when and how they change. <p/><username/>Please find a structure in the Muyu Desert that is related to the sundial,<br/>and find out how they change, and let me know.
6042	The symbolization of morning, noon, evening, and night refers to the direction in which the shadow of the sundial falls at the corresponding time. <p/>Also, the pattern on the top of this structure changes depending on the time of day. <p/>Looking at the pictures I've looked at, the pattern on the top of the structure<br/>looks like rays of light coming from a person's head...! <br/>I wonder if this person symbolizes the sun? <p/>As it's a gate with a picture of the sun on it<br/>it might be okay to name it the Gate of the Sun. <br/>Come to think of it, there are a lot of things in the desert that are related to the sun.

6052	Gather up 5 Black Forest Lizard Scales and deliver them to Alexina
6053	Hello, <username/>. Did you see the Petrified Gauntlet investigation request? <p/>Recently, I got a stone-shaped gauntlet from an adventurer like <username/>. <p/>However, I feel like it is similar to the contents of a book called the Snake Gauntlet that I had... <br/>I'm not sure, but if this is really a snake gauntlet, <br/>it should have some kind of reaction to the snake-related ruins. <p/>First, take this petrified gauntlet to the north side of Muyu Desert, <br/>near the snake-carved pillar near the giant four-legged animal pattern, and <br/>see if there is a special reaction. <p/>Oh! To check the reaction, always carry the petrified gauntlet I'm giving you now.
6054	Part of the petrification has been removed. <br/>So when I took the gauntlet and struck the pillar with the snake carving on it,<br/>the petrification of the gauntlet was removed? <br/>Then it really is the snake gauntlet from the book. <p/>Maybe I can go to other snake-related ruins and remove the remaining petrification. <br/>There is apparently a wall-crawling snake ruin on the south side of the Karu Forest, around a giant snake pattern. <p/>I wonder if I can go to the wall-crawling snake ruin and remove the remaining petrification of the petrified gauntlet... <br/>Can you check it out for me?
6055	Ah, the petrification has been removed up to the wrist. <br/>I can see a glimpse of a snake scale decoration on the wrist where the petrification has been removed. <br/>I only heard about it, but I never thought I would be able to get the snake gauntlet myself... <p/>But not all the petrification has been removed yet<br/>so I don't think I can use it like this. <p/>There's a snake pillar that's usually hidden in the Karu Forest and can be found with the<br/>L-Rod... <br/>Maybe if we examine it again we can remove more of the petrification? <p/>Search for the hidden snake pillar with the<br/>L-Rod and see if it reacts with the snake gauntlet. <p/>Do you know where the snake pillar is? <br/>It's between the giant snake pattern and the giant tree pattern in the Karu Forest.
6056	That's great! <br/>The gauntlet has been completely freed from petrification. <br/>But maybe the reason I can't wear it yet is because there are no other seals removed other than petrification...? <p/>In the book, it says that the snake scales of the darkness<br/>wake up the snake gauntlet. <br/>I think the eye-shaped symbol on the gauntlet's scales is closed,<br/>so it might still be sealed. <p/>I hear you need Dark Snake scales,<br/>but there haven't been any reports of Dark Snakes being seen in Iria yet. <br/>Maybe the only place you can get scales is from the Karu Forest lizard...? <p/>Legends and rumors can be inaccurate,<br/>so we'll just have to hope the Black Forest lizard scales will remove the seal. <br/>I'll keep this gauntlet for you. <br/>Go to Karu Forest and get about five Black Forest lizard scales.

6089	Hmm... a fat, short-necked donkey! <br/>I'm sure this sudden request confused you, <username/>. <p/>I think it might be the big-eared aardvark found on the Maize Plains. <br/>These big-eared aardvarks are found north along the Nubes Mountains, <br/>on the left side of the floral painting on the plains. <p/>Big-eared aardvarks have particularly developed ears. <br/>And they are known to be very sensitive to even the smallest sounds. <br/>They get excited easily, so be extra careful.
6090	Defeat 10 Big-eared Aardvarks
6091	Pigs have always been a symbol of wealth, but they also represent negative things like greed, lust, and anger.

6096	Collecting 5 Big-eared Aardvark Claws
6097	Have you ever heard of a creature called a Big-eared Aardvark? It looks like a pig, except it pays so much attention to its claws that some of them sport a colorful set of nails! That may be the reason why their claws are considered a collector's item. I'll give you a premium price on it, so how about getting me 5 Big-eared Aardvark Claws? You can find them at the [prairie not far from the camp].

6106	Lately I have been hearing a sudden increase in the number of Black Aardvarks around the area. Sometimes, they even come close to the Camp and rummage through travelers' bags. The damages haven't been too significant yet, but if we leave them as they are right now, who knows what will happen next? Please find those Black Aardvarks at the [prairie located in between the Camp and the giant flower mark] and defeat 10 of them

6108	Defeat 10 Black Aardvarks
6109	Report to Quest Board
6110	Black Aardvarks can be found between the camp and the giant flower mark. <br/>I guess this kind of accident happens often because the Maiz Plains are so close to the camp.
6111	Gather up 5 Black Aardvark Claws
6112	I'm a zoologist primarily studying the animals of Iria. I heard that aardvarks dig up the ground to find food, and I want to study more about their claws; what do they look like, and how they work. Please head to the prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark, where the Black Aardvarks can be found, and get 5 of their claws for me.
6113	Speak with Alexina
6114	Collect 5 Black Aardvark Claws, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6115	Come on. <br/>This is the first time I've heard of aardvarks digging up the ground to find food. <br/>You can see the black aardvark by heading all the way up the northeast side of the camp<br/>just past the big-eared aardvark habitat.

6121	If it's an animal with horns growing from its back, it's probably a horned aardvark. <br/>Horned aardvarks are known to breed in the middle of the giant flower pattern and the giant human pattern. <p/>Look northeast of the giant flower pattern on the ground and you should be able to see it.
6122	Defeat 10 Horned Aardvarks
6123	We have a bit of a problem right now, because the drinking water we had set aside has been co-opted by the Horned Aardvarks, and they've been bathing themselves in our water! Please head over to the [midpoint between the Giant Flower Mark and the Giant Human Mark in Maiz Prairie] and slay 10 of those terrible Horned Aardvarks for us.
6124	Defeat 10 Horned Aardvarks
6125	Report to Quest Board
6126	Deliver 5 Horned Aardvark Claws
6127	There's a rumor that the horn on the Horned Aardvark's back is a result of its skin changing over time, like fingernails. I wanted to look into it further, so could you get me five of their claws? The Horned Aardvarks are usually found near the [midpoint between the Giant Flower Mark and the Giant Human Mark in Maiz Prairie.]

6134	The only pigs with manes discovered in Iria so far are the Maned Aardvark and the Maned River Boar. <br/>But from what you've said, it might be closer to the Maned Aardvark. <p/>An adventurer I met recently said he spotted a Maned Aardvark while crossing the Maiz Plains.
6135	Defeat 10 Maned Aardvarks
6136	Are you aware of the fact that the Goddess of Wealth, Paiea, is also called the 'Shining Pig"? That being said, I am puzzled by all that anger from the pigs of Iria.

Doesn't that remind you of a shape of a human? Don't ask why. Just get me 5 Short Horn Gnu Hooves at the [prairie right in between the camp and the giant flower mark].

6161	Is it true that there's a horse with a horn in Iria? I thought at first it was a unicorn, but... I heard it had two horns. According to my friend, it resembled his thoroughbred, so I am guessing it isn't as graceful-looking as a unicorn.

With its sharp, thick horn, these gnus apply enough damage to the explorers that I see a number of them being rushed to the hospital here at the camp. I'd wish for the explorers to just leave them alone, but... there's at least one person out there who'd attack the gnus in hopes of obtaining their horns. To ensure that other travelers won't be in danger, please eliminate 10 Long Horn Gnus at the [prairie near the flower marking and beyond in Maiz Prairie].

6268	I am against the skinning of animals, and know people against fur traders. But even though I don't disagree with all of their arguments, I am unfortunately still a fur trader. I cannot work if I think too deeply. Just like everyday, I am quietly collecting furs. It's my livelihood...

6279	Blue is the color of druids. Not only does it symbolize the clouds and sky, it also represents peace and stability. It is boundless. Like the broad limitless sky, the color blue knows no boundaries. The reason why I want to collect Blue-legged Fennec Fox Fur is not because it is a material, but because I'd like to understand their truths.
6280	Bring 5 Blue-legged Fennec Fox Fur to the Quest Board

6285	Defeat 10 Gray-tailed Mongooses
6286	Whenever I leave camp, there are always mongooses right outside. Usually, I can confidently take them out with a Windmill; but if you see them forming a pack, punish the mongooses that are not afraid of humans.
6287	Speak with Alexina
6288	Defeat 10 Gray-tailed Mongooses
6289	Report to Quest Board
6290	Yes? Gray-tailed Mongooses are found to the northeast of camp,<br/>just past the Big-eared Aardvark breeding grounds up ahead.<br/>Some people think mongooses are cute,<br/>but because they are wild animals, they pose a threat to humans.
6291	Collect 5 Gray-tailed Monsoose Fur
6292	You're aware of the different colored mongooses, right? According to mongoose ecology theory, it appears that they have different colored tails and legs based on diet and habitat. But let's obtain some fur and investigate this a little ourselves.
6293	Speak with Alexina
6294	Bring 5 Gray-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6295	Mongoose types can be differentiated by the colors of their tails.<br/>From the base camp, the Gray-tailed Mongooses<br/>are just a bit north.<br/>You should be able to find them quickly.
6296	Black-tailed Mongoose
6297	I've heard that mongooses' tail and leg color are different according to their habitat. I'm currently researching the relationship between mongoose breeding grounds and tail color, but it isn't easy to find Black-tailed Mongooses.

6303	Defeat Black-tailed Mongooses
6304	Among the explorers, there are superstitious signs and omens. For example, if a rabbit crosses the road during your travels; it is said that something big will happen... I often hear about ominous black animals. If you come across Black-tailed Mongooses in your travels, please capture them for the sake of other explorers.
6305	Defeat 10 Black-tailed Mongooses
6306	Report to Quest Board
6307	Collect 5 Black-tailed Mongoose Fur
6308	Among the mongooses, there is a variety with a black tail and legs. And of the mongooses, Black-tailed Mongoose Fur is the best material for brushes. Brushes made with Black-tailed Mongoose Fur are called "Walking Master" brushes - half of a good brush is the fur that goes into making it.
6309	Bring 5 Black-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6310	Brown-tailed Mongoose
6311	Are you familiar with the types of mongooses? Even deadly poisonous snakes seem to be immobilized by them. Make no mistake, their faces are filled with killing intent... please investigate these animals.

6314	Report to Quest Board
6315	Have you been investigating Brown-tailed Mongooses?<br/>While it's true that mongooses capture and eat snakes,<br/>seeing them for real doesn't scare me at all.<br/>Among the many types of mongooses, the Brown-tailed Mongoose appears to be the most meek.<p/>They are all around the camp,<br/>but if you take a left out of the camp toward the foot of the Nubes Mountains<br/>or to the right toward Kaypi Canyon, you should have no trouble finding them.
6316	Defeat 10 Brown-tailed Mongooses
6317	There's probably no one else in the world that hates rodents as much as me, but I -really- hate the mongooses that are around the base camp. Imagine a bunch of rats surrounding a baby calf. I haven't been able to leave camp to shear sheep without carrying Holy Water of Lymilark on my person - how nice would it be to live without seeing mongooses...
6318	Speak with Alexina
6319	Defeat 10 Brown-tailed Mongooses
6320	Report to Quest Board
6321	As you leave the camp, you will run in to grazing sheep.<br/>The mongooses are just beyond the sheep herd.<br/>Once during the heated struggle of sheep shearing,<br/>I thought I saw a figure in the distance that looked like a sheep carder.<p/>The Brown-tailed Mongooses are all around the camp,<br/>if you take a left after leaving camp towards the Nubes Mountains<br/>or a right toward Kaypi Canyon, you should not have any trouble finding them.
6322	Collect 5 Brown-tailed Mongoose Fur
6323	Have you seen the mongooses? They appear meek, but in reality even fierce beasts and poisonous snakes keep their distance. That's why many explorers choose to wear clothing made of their furs, believing that it will protect them from such hidden dangers. As such, mongoose fur is in short supply. Would you go out to the prairie beyond the base camp and collect some?
6324	Speak with Alexina
6325	Bring 5 Brown-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6326	Because the mongooses possess an antidote material in their bodies,<br/>it appears that they easily capture poisonous snakes.<br/>They will not attack unless provoked - they are gentle animals that will also not attack from a distance.<p/>The Brown-tailed Mongooses are all around camp,<br/>if you take a left out of camp toward the foot of the Nubes Mountains <br/>or a right toward Kaypi Canyon, you should have no trouble finding them.

6333	Defeat 10 Blue-tailed Mongooses
6334	I've collected many reports regarding mongooses. It appears that they can catch even fast-moving snakes, but its difficult to grasp the mongooses' hunting habits from this alone. If you can fight them directly, would you teach me your method of doing battle?
6335	Defeat 10 Blue-tailed Mongooses
6336	Collect 5 Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur
6337	I've collected all sorts of different colored mongoose furs and crafted accessories out of them. I don't use them, but I think they made good gifts for my friends when they were just-starting adventurers. I can't take my eyes off of the Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur. It really calms me down.
6338	Bring 5 Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6339	Animal with only a White Tail
6340	White animals have been regarded as holy since antiquity. It would seem that there exists an animal in Iria whose body and tail are different colors, the tail being white... we must find out which animal this is.
6341	Look for a small animal with a white tail and sketch it.
6342	Report to Quest Board

6344	Have you ever heard of the legend where once all the White-tailed Mongooses of the prairie are defeated, the sky will become dark and monster equipped with golden armor will appear? I also haven't heard of such a thing, and I don't really believe it, but I kind of want to try... what do you think? Just this once, won't you try with me?

6349	Collect 5 White-tailed Mongoose Fur
6350	I've heard that among the young adventurers in Iria, White-tailed Mongoose Fur is popularly believed to protect the love between a man and a woman. I've also heard that the fur is starting to be regarded as a symbol of luck and safety. Because of this, White-tailed Mongoose Fur has been in short supply and has become harder to obtain.
6351	Speak with Alexina
6352	Bring 5 White-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6353	Regarding White-tailed Mongoose Fur, I think it is definitely a superstition.<br/>Even Ethna has recently been collecting White-tailed Mongoose Fur.<br/>It looks crazy but it appears to be trending lately.<p/>You can find the White-tailed Mongooses<br/>just east of the Human Mark on Maiz Prairie.

6366	In one of the books that cover apocalypse, it contained this creepy statement that says 'on the judgment day, a fearsome creature will descend upon this earth and terrorize this land with great force.' Apparently, that creature features an unusually white set of ears... and recently, those animals were found around here. Their ears were indeed white, but their body seemed quite unathletic and rotund.

6369	Defeat 10 White-eared Bush Boars
6370	The White-eared Bush Boars that you find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] may look docile and adorable, but when they are in an attack mode, they can be ruthless. Once they start charging towards a human being, they won't stop until the person is completely knocked out, so a lot of explorers get hurt in the process. If you're stuck in a forest covered with tall trees, it's near impossible to avoid their attacks.
6371	Defeat 10 White-eared Bush Boars
6372	Report to Quest Board
6373	Deliver 5 the White-eared Bush Boar Fur Bundles
6374	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the White-eared Bush Boars you'll find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.

The most common rumor states that deep in the night, with the Eweca filling the air, you can hear a metal-screeching scream coming from those rocks, with a white ghost slowly crawling out of the structure.

6453	A Bear With A Scar On Its Chest
6454	A long, long time ago, there was a pair of bears that were deeply in love. Their love for one another was unmatched, but that passion also led to constant pain caused to one another. As time went on, and as their love grow and matured, so did the pain they gave to each other. In the end, this pain caused their respective chests to be burned white, and that scar would remain with them forever, through their descendants.

6457	The reason why the bears are considered brutal is because they eat everything. With a wide, flat set of molars and strong jaw bone, it can eat insects, animals, honey, fruit, whatever.

It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know.

6492	Deliver 5 White-striped Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6493	I process the venom sac of a spider to make a tight, light gold sack. It's very elastic, so it stores a lot more gold than sacks made out of cow skin or horse skin. I'm thinking of making a wallet or a mask out of it down the road. If you happen to acquire some White-striped Desert Spider venom sacs [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], please send them to me.
6494	Gather up 5 White-striped Desert Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6495	White Spider
6496	I believe that the animals living in Iria are more like monsters than wild animals. There are some ecologists out there that these creatures all share similar genes to the animals we come to love, but these creatures... if nothing else, they're worse than the Fomors. Same with the white spiders at Iria.

6499	Defeat 10 White Desert Spiders
6500	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White Desert Spiders leave
6501	Defeat 10 White Desert Spiders
6502	Report to Quest Board
6503	Deliver 5 White Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6504	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used. I feel that if I study a Venom Sac from a White Desert Spider, then I might be able to finally find a connection between Venom Sacs and web sacs.

6506	Black Spider
6507	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used. I feel that if I study a Venom Sac from a Black Desert Spider, then I might be able to finally find a connection between Venom Sacs and web sacs.

6510	Defeat 10 Black Desert Spiders
6511	Hey there! Are you aware that Black Desert Spiders carry venom so unbelievably potent that it's plain shocking? They are so potent that a teaspoon full of it can wipe out Dunbarton in an instant. When I went to [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert], I see these Black Desert Spiders roaming around recklessly.
6512	Defeat 10 Black Desert Spiders
6513	Report to Quest Board
6514	Deliver 5 Black Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6515	I know this sounds crazy, but I plan on acquiring some Black Desert Spider venom sacs at [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert] and pour them into a lake. Don't look at me like that. There's a reason for it. Apparently, one of the components of the spider venom can actually purify water, among other things.

6517	(You complete the quest you were asked to do)
6518	Brown Mushroom of Terror
6519	There have been reports that a giant mushroom is attacking people. Obviously it's not a regular mushroom, but a giant mushroom with 8 huge feet sporting fangs. The scariest thing I heard about them is that this mushroom would wrap up innocent travelers with mysterious strings, and proceed to suck their blood. Wow... if you aren't scared after hearing this, then can you find that mushroom for me?
6520	Sketch a creature that looks like a brown mushroom
6521	Report to Quest Board
6522	Defeat 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders
6523	Spiders don't offer too much threat to the explorers, but the explorers do run into some tight situations when running into a sticky cobweb in between the trees in a forest. For the sake of other explorers, I want you to eliminate 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest].
6524	Defeat 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders
6525	Report to Quest Board
6526	Deliver 5 Brown Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs
6527	When you slay those spiders in Iria, you'll acquire a venom sac from time to time. The venom from Forest Mushroom Spider is actually used to create an antidote potion. Lately I have been working on creating one of my own, so I have been gathering up Brown Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]. Please gather up those venom sacs for me, and be careful of their sharp teeth and claws.
6528	Gather up 5 Brown Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6529	Red Mushroom
6530	If you are lost along the trails, the first thing you should do is to quickly find out where you currently are. That way, you will not lose your sense of direction. I remember once when I got lost, I noticed a giant red mushroom out of the corner of my eye. I used it as a reference marker as I tried to make my way, but I soon realized something about it was odd. It was as if the mushroom had its own set of legs, because it kept getting further and further away from me. What if that mushroom really wasn't one?

6533	Defeat 10 Red Forest Mushroom Spiders
6534	The region [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] is so destitute and dried out because of the venom Red Forest Mushroom Spiders drip from time to time. Their venom is so potent that they have collectively destroyed the land in that area
6535	Defeat 10 Red Forest Mushroom Spiders
6536	Report to Quest Board
6537	Deliver 5 Red Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs
6538	The Red Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs that can be found [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] are coveted more for the sac itself, as opposed to the venom inside. Since it's a sac that holds that potent venom, the durability must be outstanding to say the least.
6539	Gather up 5 Red Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6540	In search of the blue mushroom
6541	I am a renowned expert in mushroom-related delicacies in Dunbarton, and I have used pretty much every kind of mushroom for my dishes. I hear that at Karu Forest in Iria, there's a giant, moving blue mushroom, and I am intrigued by it. Can you dig up some information on it for me?

6545	It hasn't been long since I started studying the Green Forest Mushroom Spiders. At first, I thought they were just giant mutant spiders, but the more I studied them, the more I found out about these creatures. I have also realized that they are a legitimate threat to mankind here.

6556	Do you know why we humans are more superior to animals? That's because only humans can create and establish their own world. Do not hesitate to eliminate some animals in Iria. Head over to a region [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] and eliminate those Black Forest Mushroom Spiders that keep standing in the explorers' ways, and make this place a better place to live for us all!

6559	Deliver 5 Black Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs
6560	You know how the opposites attract? The venom sac from Black Forest Mushroom Spiders found [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] may contain potentially lethal poison, but the same poison can be used as an ingredient for a potion.

7020	I've heard that people who have been to the deepest parts of [Karu Forest Ruins] have witnessed there a Glowing Pot-Belly Spider. There's nothing more shocking to explorers than the sight of light from the middle of nowhere, and the light's origin is a mystery.
7021	Eliminate 1 Glowing Pot-Belly Spider
7022	Report to Quest Board
7023	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
7024	At [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a Stone Hound there that glows unlike others. No one knows exactly what it is, and since no one knows about it, it poses as a serious threat to explorers that visit the ruins.
7025	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
7026	Report to Quest Board
7027	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Bison
7028	The fear you experience when you face the Glowing Stone Bison is indescribable. I do not wish that on anyone. Please eliminate the Glowing Stone Bison that can be found at [Karu Forest Ruins].
7029	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Bison
7030	Report to Quest Board
7031	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Zombie
7032	Glowing Stone Zombies are the most mysterious creatures you can ever find. No one knows anything about it, and so many people have visited the [Karu Forest Ruins] in hopes of figuring out the mysterious glow it produces. Most of them wound up never coming back out of the ruins.

7035	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Imp
7036	The term 'light' usually symbolizes purity, the power that drives away what is evil and corrupt in this world... but after seeing the Glowing Stone Imp first hand at [Karu Forest Ruins]... I realized that the opposite may be true as well.

7039	내 머리는 돼지털
7040	학교에 갔더니 내 머리카락을 보고 돼지 털 돼지 털 하는데 곱게 자란 저로서는 도무지 그 뜻을 알 수가 없네요. 제 머리카락과 비교해 직접 확인해보고 싶은데 작은 귀 땅돼지 털 5개만 구해다 줄 수 있을까요? 음...이렇게 힘들게 부탁할 필요까지 있겠냐고요? 당연하죠! 나는 소중하니까요.
7041	작은 귀 땅돼지 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7042	흰 덤불 멧돼지 털 5개 수집
7043	미술용 붓들은 동물 털을 사용해 만들어진답니다. 말, 다람쥐, 돼지 등등 다양한 동물의 털이 사용되는데 그 종류에 따라 붓이 종이에 닿는 느낌도 달라진다고 하네요. 최근 이리아에서 새롭게 등장한 흰 덤불 멧돼지 털이 미술 재료상의 관심을 끌고 있는 건 어쩌면 자연스러운 일이겠지요.
7044	흰 덤불 멧돼지 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7045	흰 사막 여우 털 5개 수집
7046	가장 향기로운 향수는 언제나 가장 작은 병에 담겨있기 마련이지요. 흰색 사막 여우의 털이 그렇게 값이 나가는 이유도 이와 비슷하지 않을까요?

7048	황금 꼬리 몽구스 털 5개 수집
7049	엄밀하게 말하면 일반 몽구스의 털이나 황금 꼬리 몽구스의 털이나 품질에 있어 차이는 크지 않아요. 그런데도 유독 황금 꼬리 몽구스의 털을 구해달라는 고객들이 많네요. 그건 아무래도 희소성 때문이겠지요?

7051	황금 숲 도마뱀 비늘 15개를 수집
7052	황금 숲 도마뱀의 비늘은 실제 황금보다 더 값어치가 나가죠. 황금 숲 도마뱀만 전문적으로 사냥하는 사람들이 생겨났을 정도로 수집가들 사이에서 인기가 좋답니다.

7055	거대 황금 숲 버섯 거미에서 다른 버섯 거미들과 마찬가지로 독 주머니가 발견되고 있다네. 이것은 거대 황금 숲 버섯 거미가 숲 버섯 거미의 변종이 아닐까 하는 내 가설을 뒷받침하는 부분이지. 물론 좀 더 연구가 필요하겠지만... 아무래도 정확한 결론을 내기 위해서는 독 주머니들을 모아 분석을 해봐야겠네.

7057	우두머리 하이에나의 털 5개 수집
7058	무슨 이유에선지는 모르겠지만 하이에나 털은 의외로 인기가 없어요. 하지만 우두머리 하이에나만큼은 예외지요. 무엇보다 녀석의 목 언저리에 솟아있는 풍성한 갈기 만큼은 최상급으로 쳐주거든요.

7060	늑대 무늬 사막 거미 독주머니 5개 수집
7061	늑대 무늬 사막 거미에게 독주머니가 있다는 사실은 아주 최근에 와서야 밝혀지게 된 사실입니다. 늑대 무늬 사막 거미의 공격적인 성격이 이 독주머니에서 나오는 거라 예상하고 있는 저로서는 좀 더 실험을 해봐야 알 수 있을 거 같아요. 이를 위해 독주머니가 필요합니다.

7291	Hello, <username/>. <br/>Today, I'll give you some good news. <p/>You know the treasure chests found all over Rano, right? <br/>These chests often give out stones with a gauntlet pattern, and <br/>I'm sure <username/> has heard of them. <p/>I got hold of the stone with a gauntlet pattern, <br/>and after studying it in various ways and asking explorers, <br/>I finally found a way to restore it! <p/>Once you completely restore the stone with a gauntlet pattern, <br/>you will receive a gauntlet with snake scales on the ankle. <br/>The restored gauntlet is called a snake gauntlet. <p/>It is said that when you wear it, you can get a great effect in battles with certain monsters. <p/><username/>If you want, I can restore the snake gauntlet for you. <br/>First, use the L-Rod to find a treasure chest yourself, or<br/>get help from people around you<br/>to obtain a gauntlet-patterned stone and bring it to me.
7292	It was hard to find a treasure chest<br/>and it's hard to get a gauntlet-patterned stone from a treasure chest...<br/>That was tough. <p/>While I was investigating these gauntlet-patterned stones that many explorers had found and brought to me<br/>I accidentally discovered that petrification can be reversed with lizard scales. <p/>I'll tell you more if you bring me 5 scales of the White Forest lizard in the Karu Forest. <br/>It's a necessary material to reverse petrification. <p/>And... I'm keeping the gauntlet-patterned stone that <username/> brought to me.

7743	<show_dir pos='170000 177000' pitch='15'/>The right side of the camp will not be too far from the young Brown-tailed Mongoose.<br/>Every time you (play something), you will increase your Fighter skills level.<br/>Then, your Fighter proficiency will be increased from Novice to rank F.<br/>If you have never (battled?) before, I think attacking 10 times should be sufficient?<p/>By the way, after gaining enough proficiency,<br/>open your skill window and be sure to click the yellow Learn button!
7744	<username/>, is this your first time learning these skills？<br/>There are many skills to learn in the future.<br/>Increasing your Fighter skills can improve your strength.<p/>Learning and ranking skills consume AP,<br/>so be sure to think carefully about your skill choices... <br/>You can learn other skills later.

Move your mouse to the bottom<br/>to click the skill button.<br/>You can also use the S key.<p/>You see the rest of your skills, right?<br/>Because we're currently in a conversation, you cannot use the skill, but you can use it afterwards.<br/>In the skills window, click or drag the skill icon<br/>to the shortcut bar, or you can use a shortcut key instead.<p/>The Rest skill is mainly used to restore health.<br/>Besides the ability to restore health,<br/>another helpful ability is that it can treat your injuries.<p/>Mana is the only one that cannot be immediately restored.<br/>When night falls and Eweca rises, mana will regenerate.<br/>However, during the day, staying near the Mana Tunnel will quickly regenerate mana.<p/>If you raise the rank of Rest, your maximum health value will increase<p/>There are a variety of skills to rank, however ranking skills blindly may leave you with regrets<br/>,so plan accordingly.<p/>It's our first time meeting, so I may have said too much...<br/>but if you have any other questions, you may come find me.

7760	It isn't easy to catch the young Brown-tailed Mongoose?<br/><username/>...See it is  difficult to train fighter skills.<br/>Blindly attacking will give the enemy a chance to counterattack.<br/>... Firstly, it is critical that you defend the other's attack, before counterattacking.<p/>This skill is called Defense.<br/>You seem to have a somewhat decent understanding of Defense, although it could use some work.<br/>so I'll just tell you.<p/>Defense is a commonly used skill, so it is best to set a shortcut for it.<br/>Simply put, the Defense skill's greatest ability<br/>is to resist and withstand the enemy's attack,<br/>you should use it upon your first opportunity.<p/>Remember that defense isn't capable of withstanding all attacks,<br/>But you should use it when given the chance.<image name='Die'/>... There is strength in patience<br/>Keep practicing with the defense skills.<p/>Once you master the defense skill<br/>come see me and I will teach you about other combat skills.

7768	Hey! <username/>, have you gotten used to fighting a bit? <br/>Are you using the defense I taught you properly? <br/>But on the other hand, when your opponent uses defense,<br/>it's frustrating, right? <p/><image name='smash'/>So, what I'm going to teach you next is a skill called Smash, which can destroy defense and attack! <br/>It's a one-hit kill technique, and its characteristic is its great destructive power. It's a powerful skill, and when you pull it off, you feel great! <p/>Smash has the characteristic that it can ignore the opponent's defense,<br/>so you decide on a target and then hit them with one powerful attack. <br/>So the defense of the targeted opponent is removed. <p/><image name='smash'/>Until now, if your opponent uses defense, you've waited until the skill disappeared, right? <br/>But from now on, that's no longer necessary. Now that you've learned how to use a smash,<br/>even if your opponent is defending, you can just attack with a smash.<br/>Of course, you should also think about the counterattack from your opponent after attacking with a smash!

7778	Have you heard of campfires?<br/>To make a campfire, you first need firewood.<br/>First, find 5 pieces of firewood in the area. <p/>It may be hard to get used to it since it's your first time, but<br/>it's surprisingly easy. <p/>First, I'll give you an axe, so hold it in your right hand and<br/>click on the trees around you. <br/>The cursor will then change to an axe shape,<br/>so you can continue clicking to collect firewood. <p/>You should be able to collect firewood easily in nearby places,<br/>so you don't have to go too far. <br/>Let's give it a try! <p/>
7779	How was it? Was it easy? <br/>Thank you for bringing the firewood. <br/>I'll use the firewood you gave me for the campfire.

I need to make a sign for that, but I don't have enough nails. <br/>It's a very important job for me... <br/>so could you please find some nails for me? <p/>Place your cursor on the nearby wooden box, <br/>and when the cursor turns into a fist, try hitting the box. <br/>When you hit it like that, a nail may come out, so <br/>can you collect 5 nails in total? <p/>Please call me when you've finished collecting them. <br/>Thank you.
7785	Thank you very much for your help, <username/>. <br/>As a thank you, I'll give you a book that will help you make a good campfire. <p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>Collect firewood and use this skill to make a campfire. <br/>Resting around a campfire<br/>will help you recover health, stamina, and injuries faster. <p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>Oh... and at a campfire<br/>you can share any food you have with everyone. <br/>When eating food around a campfire, it's a good idea to gather around the camp<br/>for camp sharing.

8024	<username/>. <br/>Did you get the charm? <p/><face name='surprise'/>What's wrong? <br/>Something's wrong. <br/>Did Stewart say something to you? <p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(I told Eavan what Stewart told me)<p/>……. <p/><face name='love'/>S-Stewart is a real problem. <br/>He's saying weird things again... <p/><face name='shyness2'/>Please don't misunderstand me. <br/>It's nothing so big. <p/>So it's not like I like you <username/> or anything... <p/><face name='shyness'/>W-what am I talking about! <br/>But anyway, please don't get me wrong. <p/>However, when I thought about what I could do,<br/>this was the only thing I could think of. <p/><face name='sad'/>... <p/><face name='normal'/><image name='G3_ch15_amulet_ring'/>That ring is a very important thing that my mother gave me. <br/>So please return it to me once this matter is over. <br/><username/> will definitely come back to return it to me. <p/><face name='smile2'/>When that time comes, please come back in good health so that I can greet you with a smile. <br/>I'll be waiting...
8025	Hmm... a fat donkey with a short neck... <br/><username/>, maybe you misheard? <p/>I think you're probably talking about the big-eared aardvarks that live on the Maiz Plains... <br/>Big-eared aardvarks are often seen on the plains not far from this base camp. <p/>Big-eared aardvarks have particularly developed ears, and are very sensitive to even the smallest sounds. <br/>They get excited easily, so you'd better be careful.
8026	Pigs have always been a symbol of wealth, but they also represent negative things like greed, lust, and anger. The pigs in Iria are exceptionally negative in that regard, and they are prone to harming the residents of the camp. Please head over to the [prairie not far from the camp] and slay 10 Big-eared Aardvarks for us.
8027	I don't know if the pigs' bad temper is due to their dark attributes, but it's true that the aardvarks in Iria are particularly aggressive! <p/>Recently, many people around us have been harmed... <br/>Big-eared aardvarks are often spotted on the plains near the base camp.
8028	Have you ever heard of a creature called a Big-eared Aardvark? It looks like a pig, except it pays so much attention to its claws that some of them sport a colorful set of nails! That may be the reason why their claws are considered a collector's item. I'll give you a premium price on it, so how about getting me 5 Big-eared Aardvark Claws? You can find them at the [prairie not far from the camp].
8029	This big-eared aardvark lives on the plains not far from base camp. <p/>Big-eared aardvarks have particularly developed ears, and are very sensitive to even the smallest sounds. <br/>They get excited easily, so you'd better be careful.
8030	Lately I have been hearing a sudden increase in the number of Black Aardvarks around the area. Sometimes, they even come close to the camp and rummage through travelers' bags. The damage hasn't been too significant yet, but if we leave them as they are right now, who knows what will happen next? Please find those Black Aardvarks at the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark] and defeat 10 of them.
8031	Black Aardvarks are often seen between the camp and the giant flower mark. <br/>I guess it's because the camp is close to Maiz Plains that accidents like this happen so often.
8032	I'm a zoologist primarily studying the animals of Iria. I heard that aardvarks dig up the ground to find food, and I want to study more about their claws; what they look like, and how they work. Please head to the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark], where the Black Aardvarks can be found, and get 5 of their claws for me.
8033	Well...<br/>I've never heard of aardvarks digging up the ground to find food.<br/>If you're looking for a black aardvark, head all the way northeast<br/>and you should be able to see it in the plain between the camp and the giant flower mark.
8034	Have you ever seen a creature with a horn on its back in Iria? Well apparently, an animal has been spotted where it looks like it has a horn on its back.

8035	A group of horned aardvarks splashed around in the water we had stored for drinking, causing a lot of damage. Please get rid of the 10 horned aardvarks in [halfway between the giant flower pattern and the giant human pattern on Maiz Plains].
8036	There's a rumor that the horn on the Horned Aardvark's back is the result of its skin changing over time, like fingernails. I wanted to look into it further, so could you get me five of their claws? The Horned Aardvarks are usually found near the [midpoint between the Giant Flower Mark and the Giant Human Mark in Maiz Prairie.]
8037	Up until now, the only pigs with manes on their backs that have been found in Iria are the Maned Aardvark and the Maned River Boar. <br/>But from what you've said, it might be closer to the Maned Aardvark. <p/>An adventurer I met recently told me that Maned Aardvarks have been seen in a wide area around the Giant Flower Mark in Maiz Prairie.
8038	Are you aware of the fact that the Goddess of Wealth, Paiea, is also called the 'Shining Pig'? That being said, I am puzzled by all that anger from the pigs of Iria. Please eliminate 10 Maned Aardvarks [near the giant flower mark in Maiz Prairie]. They have been causing a lot of trouble with the explorers these days.
8039	Paiea, the Goddess of Wealth, also represents Iweka. Pigs originally symbolized wealth... In reality, they are ferocious monsters that torment adventurers and people living nearby. Maned Aardvarks are widely scattered around the giant flower mark in Maiz Prairie.
8040	I need 5 claws of Maned Aardvark that can be found [spread out all around the giant flower mark in Maiz Prairie]. If you can get me those claws, I will reward you well for your effort.
8041	I'm not sure why, but recently a lot of people have been asking for Short Horn Gnus claws. I can't give you a Short Horn Gnus claw, but I can at least tell you where they live. They are often spotted in the wide area around the giant flower mark on the northeast side of the camp, in the Maiz Plains.
8042	Please defeat 10 Short Horn Gnus that can be found at a [prairie located at the midpoint of the camp and the giant flower mark].
8043	Have you ever given a deep thought to the meaning of the number 5? 5 is a microcosm of the big universe, and it represents human. Look up the sky and think of a pentagon-shaped star. Doesn't that remind you of a shape of a human? Don't ask why. Just get me 5 Short Horn Gnu Hooves at the [prairie right in between the camp and the giant flower mark]. It'd be nice if you can think of what I just told you as you pick up each hoof.
8044	Long Horn Gnus are generally very calm, but once they tick, they are some of the scariest creatures out there. With its sharp, thick horn, these gnus apply enough damage to the explorers that I see a number of them being rushed to the hospital here at the camp. I'd wish for the explorers to just leave them alone, but... there's at least one person out there who'd attack the gnus in hopes of obtaining their horns. To ensure that other travelers won't be in danger, please eliminate 10 Long Horn Gnus at the [prairie near the flower marking and beyond in Maiz Prairie].
8045	The gnus' hooves are big in size and solid in texture, so they are used for sculptures and accessories. The hooves of the Long Horn Gnu are considered the very best, but they are also really hard to get... I hear that finding Long Horn Gnus itself is very difficult. If you ever pass by a [prairie near the flower marking and beyond in Maiz Prairie], please find a way to obtain 5 Long Horn Gnu Hooves for me.
8046	Based on my research, Cactus Lizard is basically a cactus drawing the lizard in, and attach itself onto the back of the lizard. This also means when the lizard dies, the cactus will find another lizard to latch on to... to make sure this is true, I want you to find 10 Cactus Lizards [all around the central part of Muyu Desert] and eliminate them, then see if any change occurs.
8047	I am an ecologist studying the lives of desert animals. Cactus Lizards are known to obtain nutrients and moisture from cactus through its scales. If that is indeed true, then I think it's a monumental discovery that breaks the boundaries between animals and plants. If you ever find yourself in [central Muyu Desert], please get me 5 Cactus Lizard Scales that'll help me validate this theory.
8048	Is there a creature out there as vicious and cruel as Long Mane Hyenas? You can find them at a [corner that heads to Karu Forest in central Muyu Desert], and I want you to defeat 10 Long Mane Hyenas for me.
8049	I need 5 Long Mane Hyena Claws that you can find at the [corner that heads to Karu Forest in central Muyu Desert]. Whoever can get me those will be handsomely rewarded.
8050	There are some ruthless Hyenas out there who would wait until your weapon durability sinks, then ambush you when that happens. Unlike regular Hyenas, these Hyenas do not have any stripes on them. Even my friend got ambushed once, and he's been shaken up ever since. Go to the [corner in Muyu Desert that leads to either a prairie or a forest] to find some Stripeless Hyenas, and teach them a lesson for me, will you?
8051	Hyena Claws have long been linked to dark sorcery. they're said to be a charm which brings destruction. If you happen to pick up some Stripeless Hyena Claws at the [corner of Muyu Desert leading to a prairie or a forest], please bring them to me at once, for they might be dangerous to even carry
8052	What do you think about the hyenas? When someone is referred to as hyena-like, that would probably include all the negative meanings like greed, negativity, and indecisiveness. Please eliminate 10 Striped Hyenas that can be found [spread out all over central Muyu Desert].
8053	Some hyena claws are related to sorcery, but probably not for a good reason. Something like a charm that attracts disasters? If you pick up some Striped Hyena Claws that can be found [spread out all over central Muyu Desert], please bring them to me, for it may be dangerous to handle.
8054	Please slay 10 Short Mane Hyenas that keeps attacking innocent explorers at the [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest]. Your efforts will be rewarded.
8055	Are you aware of the putrid odor that emits from Short Mane Hyena? Those that had the unfortunate experience say it's similar to that of a rotten egg. It may be because of the rotten carcass stuck in the claws that they don't wash after a night of hunting. The interesting thing about this is that the same claw also contains ingredients that cure a devastating sickness. Please head to a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest] and gather up 5 Short Mane Hyenas.
8056	On the way back to the camp after a night of exploring, I was ambushed by a herd of Cactus Lizards in the desert and almost got buried six feet under. After a long struggle, I thought I had managed to escape the madness, when I got knocked out by a sneak attack by a Brown-legged Fennec Fox. Can anyone slay 10 of those foxes at [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Maiz Prairie, and nearby the coastline]?
8057	I am a fashion designer, famous for my work with fur coats and fur scarves. From what I hear, the foxes in Iria feature a very distinctive color on their fur, but they lack in softness and shine. Is that true? FI hear that Brown-legged Fennec Fox fur found [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Maiz Prairie, and nearby the coastline] are the most common and useful fur in the area.
8058	Black is the color of confusion and death. Just the thought of a black-legged fox creeps me out. Right now I have been busy singlehandedly trying to eliminate Black-legged Fennec Foxes around the area, but it's not enough. Can you please come help me? Go find a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest] and eliminate 10 Black-legged Fennec Foxes for me.
8059	I am a fashion designer, famous for my work with fur coats and fur scarves. I want to express myself through my works featuring Black-legged Fennec Fox fur. I just need 5 Black-legged Fennec Fox fur that can be found at a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest]...
8060	Everything passes in time. The beauty of sunrise does not sustain for more than a few hours, and neither does rain. The moment you accept your mortality is when you can truly move on and continue with your life. I know this is boring to you, but please eliminate 10 Gray-legged Fennec Foxes at [a path that crosses the south passage of Maiz Prairie and south passage of Karu Forest located south of Muyu Desert.]
8061	Gray Fennec Foxes are really tough to find in Uladh. That may be the main reason why any accessory made out of Gray Fennec Fox fur are sold at a premium. Can you head over to [a path that crosses the south passage of Maiz Prairie and south passage of Karu Forest located south of Muyu Desert] and get me 5 Gray Fennec Fox fur?
8062	On the way back to the camp after a night of exploring, I was ambushed by a herd of Cactus Lizards in the desert and almost got buried six feet under. After a long struggle, I thought I had managed to escape the madness, when I got knocked out by a sneak attack by a Red-legged Fennec Fox. Can anyone slay 10 of those foxes [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Kaypi Canyon, near the coastline?]
8063	I know of some people that are completely against the use of fur, and some of them go to the extremes of showing hatred towards those that deal with the said fur. I don't disagree with their stance, but alas, I deal with fur. "I am just a regular merchant who collects Red-Legged Fennec Fox's fur [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Kaypi Canyon, and the nearby the coastline.]That's what a real life is.
8064	Don't you see how tired I look these days? That's because of the Blue-Legged Fennec Foxes that cry every night near the [giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], and I haven't gotten any rest for days. All because of those foxes. I want someone to go there and eliminate some of those foxes for me. Can you do that?
8065	Blue is the color of the Druids. Blue represents clouds and clear skies, as well as peace and stability. The color blue stands for something that cannot be contained. Like a clear blue sky, blue knows no limits. I hope you understand now why my request to have you gather up some Blue-legged Fennec Fox fur in the [giant mark of a four-legged animal in Muyu Desert] is not just for the materials
8066	Whenever I set foot outside the camp, I get hounded with Mongooses. When that happens, though, I just give them a faint smile, followed by a whirlwind of Windmill that would completely wipe them out... hehehe... if you ever see a herd of Gray-tailed Mongooses at a [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark], please teach them a lesson or two on how dangerous humans are.
8067	Yes, the Grey-tailed Mongoose can be found near the huge flower pattern to the north-east of here. Occasionally, people say they are cute, but because they are still a wild animal, they can still be a danger to people.
8068	You know that each Mongoose features a different color for their tails as opposed to their legs, right? They say that the evolution of Mongoose over the centuries have differentiated their color of the tail as opposed to the legs. I hear that those characteristics are affected by what they eat, and the place they live in, so I want you to gather up some Gray-tailed Mongoose fur from the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark] for me, so I can conduct a research on it.
8069	You can typically distinguish the species by the colour of their tails. The Grey-tailed Mongoose can be found at the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark].
8070	It sounds as though you're talking about a Black-tailed Mongoose. As you can probably tell, Black-tailed Mongooses are difficult to find. Recently, though, I've obtained information on where you can find some <p/>Black-tailed Mongooses can be found [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie].
8071	There's a number of superstitions that the explorers abide by. One of those is that they believe spotting a black animal during their journey is always a bad omen. If you spot a Black-tailed Mongoose at a spot [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie], please eliminate some of them for the sake of future explorers that'd cross that area.
8072	Black-tailed Mongooses that can be found [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] are a great source of fur... to make brush heads. That's why people refer to Black-tailed Mongooses as a walking 5-star brush. If you find a way to gather up their fur, you can pretty much say you're halfway through creating the perfect brush.
8073	Are you investigating brown-tailed mongooses? <br/>It's true that mongooses catch and eat snakes, but <br/>when you see them in person, they're not scary at all. <br/>Among the various mongooses, the brown-tailed mongoose is said to be the most docile type. <p/>You can see them not far from the camp.
8074	Seriously... you won't find anyone in the world who'd be more traumatized about rats that me, but those creatures around the camp, Mongooses... them, I can't stand at all. Can you imagine a rat that's as big as a cow walking around the area? I need to gather up some Holy Water of Lymilark, and I'll have to shear some sheep [around the camp], but... I really wish I don't have to see those Brown-tailed Mongooses.
8075	Have you seen a Mongoose? Unlike its rather gentile appearance, it is powerful enough to defeat a venomous snake in a blink of an eye. That's what led the explorers to believe that an armor covered on Mongoose fur would protect them from unforeseen danger. Go [not far from the camp, left or right] and gather up some Brown-tailed Mongoose fur for me, okay?
8076	I heard that there are Blue-tailed Mongoose at Maiz Prairie. They can be found [midway between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie].
8077	I have been gathering up a lot of information on Mongoose lately. It's fast and quick enough to handily capture snakes, but that's not enough to pinpoint their hunting tendencies just yet. If possible, I'd like for you to battle a Blue-tailed Mongoose yourself at a [midpoint between a giant flower mark and a giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] and let me know how they really fight in combat situation.
8078	I've been gathering up Mongoose fur in different colors to make accessories. It's not really for me, though. It's for a friend of mine who's going to explore the world for the first time. I realized that out of all the Mongoose fur, I think the Blue-tailed Mongoose fur that you can find at a [midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] makes me feel calm whenever I look at them. It must be the color...
8079	Have you heard of a rumor that when you wipe out all the White-tailed Mongooses that can be found [around the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie, and just a bit beyond that], the sky will turn black, and a monster that's decked out in gold armor will descend upon this place. I thought it wasn't worth paying attention to at first, but... over time, that's what really makes me want to try it once, just to see if it is true or not. Aren't you curious? Do you want to help me do this?
8080	... If you defeat all the White-tailed Mongooses, the sky will turn black, and a monster wearing golden armour will call down thunder from the sky? You... don't believe this rumor, do you? If you did, I'd be rather disappointed in you. <p/> Anyways, you can find the White-tailed Mongoose [around the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie, and just a bit beyond that].
8081	There's a growing belief among the younger dating explorers in Iria that the White-tailed Mongoose fur helps protect the love they have for one another. There's even a saying that Mongoose used to represent luck and safety, and it evolved over time to becoming a symbol of protection of love. That's why we have been running out of White-tailed Mongoose fur that are primarily from [the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie and beyond].
8082	The rumors that the White-tailed Mongoose's fur bestows good luck are still about, and it seems that it has also become fashionable, so we've been running out of fur. You can find White-tailed Mongooses at [the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie and beyond].
8083	I got information that there is a hidden ruin between the valley in the south-western part of the Muyu Desert, and Karu Forest. However, I can't concentrate on my work due to the white kiwi wandering around...  Can you kill the kiwis around there, please?
8084	It seems the demand for Kiwi Feathers increased, especially for those who visited Iria. There was an interesting rumor that Kiwi Feathers are lucky like Four-Leafed Clovers. So, why don't you bring me 5 White Kiwi Feathers? You can them between the south-western part of the Muyu Desert, and Karu Forest.
8085	The White-eared Bush Boars that you find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] may look docile and adorable, but when they are in an attack mode, they can be ruthless. Once they start charging towards a human being, they won't stop until the person is completely knocked out, so a lot of explorers get hurt in the process. If you're stuck in a forest covered with tall trees, it's near impossible to avoid their attacks.
8086	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the White-eared Bush Boars you'll find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8087	Just like regular boars, Bush Boars also dig up the ground in search of food. Every so often, they create huge puddles that horses trip over. Please head [a little south of the central Karu Forest] and please eliminate the suddenly-increasing number of Maned Bush Boars.
8088	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Maned Bush Boars you'll find [a little south of the central Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8089	Whenever I cross Karu Forest in search of artifacts, I spend too much time fighting the Big-eared Bush Boars. I really do not have the time to fight them all by myself, so if anyone can eliminate 10 Big-eared Bush Boars at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that], I will reward you for your work.
8090	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Black-eared Bush Boars you'll find [southern region of Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8091	Black-eared Bush Boars love to roll around mud and tree leaves, and their stench is unmistakable. Not only do they carry around that foul smell of theirs, but they also carry some nasty diseases that we may be vulnerable against. Please eliminate these Black-eared Bush Boars at the [southern region of Karu Forest].
8092	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Black-eared Bush Boars you'll find [southern region of Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8093	Lately the number of Green Forest Lizards have skyrocketed in an area [a little south of the central Karu Forest], threatening Iria's ecosystem. Nature requires balance as much as humans do, and if things like this happens, the humans may have to do something about it.
8094	People from old days believed that lizards belonged in Eweca, an incarnation of water. They also believed that it didn't have tongue and drank dew dropped in between rocks. Green Forest Lizards, found [a little south of the central Karu Forest], are believed to have frost-like element in their scales from the dew being frozen inside, and people that believe in it seem to look for their scales as a result.
8095	People who are getting fed up with the damage Black Forest Lizards cause have decided to take matters into their own hands and started a movement towards the complete destruction of them. Can you please supplement their efforts and eliminate Black Forest Lizards [a little south of the Central Karu Forest]? It's the culmination of small efforts like this that will eventually make Iria a better place to live.
8096	I have collected the scales of Black Forest Lizard, White Forest Lizard, Brown Forest Lizard, and Gold Forest Lizard. I am missing the one of a Black Forest Lizard. The problem is, I am in an emergency situation right now and I'll have to leave Iria for a bit, and so I'll need someone else's help in acquiring a Black Forest Lizard scale, most likely found [a little south of the central Karu Forest].
8097	I believe the way I judge people is very real. I just judge people based on what I see with my own eyes. That's the most important thing. If you can head to the [center of Karu Forest, and a bit north of that] and eliminate 10 White Forest Lizards, then I will be respecting you to the amount of someone that defeated 10 lizards.
8098	I hear that the demand for lizard scales have skyrocketed these days. I have no idea exactly where they are going to be used, but that doesn't matter. I'm a business person, and wherever there's a demand, I'll be carrying them with me. That's why... can you do me a favor and go to the [center of Karu Forest, and a bit north of that] and gather up 5 White Forest Lizard scales for me?
8099	Have you heard about the curse of Brown Forest Lizard found at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that]? They say that if you're a victim of the Lizard's Curse, then your soul will be tied to the Brown Forest Lizard. Unfortunately... I think I am suffering from the said curse myself. Lately I have been feeling strange at my self...please help me break from this devastating curse.
8100	There are some shady people that would repackage the Brown Forest Lizard scales as Dragon scales and charge premium for them, causing a huge outrage in the Uladh market place. How can people not tell the difference between dragon scales and lizard scales? Now that I hear this... I am curious to see what the Brown Forest Lizard scales may look like. You'll find them at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that], too.
8101	The reason why the bears are considered brutal is because they eat everything. With a wide, flat set of molars and strong jaw bone, it can eat insects, animals, honey, fruit, whatever. That got me thinking... don't you think we're quite similar to them as well? Anyway, please head over to the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that] and eliminate these brutal Manchurian White Bears.
8102	A friend from back home wrote me a letter saying he's worried about the incoming winter, because he really can't stand cold. I was thinking of a unique gift for him, and I came up with an idea. How about a muffler made out of Manchurian White Bear fur found at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that]? Can you help me get it for me?
8103	Manchurian Black Bears [nearby the giant tree mark, and a little south of the central Karu Forest] have completely wiped out the berries in nearby regions, and it's getting to the point where we may never be able to re-grow them. I have been gaining weight lately, so I need a lot of those anyway to lose weight, but this is not good at all.
8104	I'll need to come up with some gifts for the folks back home before I go back soon, and I guess I'll have to give them some authentic Iria products, right? I kept wondering what kind of a present my family would want, and decided that Manchurian Black Bear fur that can be found [around the giant tree mark, and a little south of the central Karu Forest] would be perfect. If I knot them up and make a key chain out of it, then I think the folks will really like it.
8105	Whenever I see those long-legged spiders crawling around, they give me the biggest creeps. At least the Cactus Lizards are cute, you know... whenever I cross the desert, I'd run into a White-spot Desert Spider [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], and that would scare me like nothing else. Can somebody please eliminate these White-spot Desert Spiders for me?
8106	Desert spiders are very venomous, so you must be careful at all times. There's a lot of people lately that have been bit by these venomous spiders, so I have been gathering up venom sacs of different spiders to study and create the ultimate antidote. To help facilitate this process, can you please head over to a spot [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert] and find some White-spot Desert Spider venom sacs for me?
8107	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White-striped Desert Spiders leave.
8108	I process the venom sac of a spider to make a tight, light gold sack. It's very elastic, so it stores a lot more gold than sacks made out of cow skin or horse skin. I'm thinking of making a wallet or a mask out of it down the road. If you happen to acquire some White-striped Desert Spider venom sacs [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], please send them to me.
8109	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White Desert Spiders leave
8110	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used. I feel that if I study a Venom Sac from a White Desert Spider, then I might be able to finally find a connection between Venom Sacs and web sacs.
8111	Hey there! Are you aware that Black Desert Spiders carry venom so unbelievably potent that it's plain shocking? They are so potent that a teaspoon full of it can wipe out Dunbarton in an instant. When I went to [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert], I see these Black Desert Spiders roaming around recklessly.
8112	I know this sounds crazy, but I plan on acquiring some Black Desert Spider venom sacs at [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert] and pour them into a lake. Don't look at me like that. There's a reason for it. Apparently, one of the components of the spider venom can actually purify water, among other things.
8113	Spiders don't offer too much threat to the explorers, but the explorers do run into some tight situations when running into a sticky cobweb in between the trees in a forest. For the sake of other explorers, I want you to eliminate 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]
8114	When you slay those spiders in Iria, you'll acquire a venom sac from time to time. The venom from Forest Mushroom Spider is actually used to create an antidote potion. Lately I have been working on creating one of my own, so I have been gathering up Brown Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]. Please gather up those venom sacs for me, and be careful of their sharp teeth and claws.
8115	The region [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] is so destitute and dried out because of the venom Red Forest Mushroom Spiders drip from time to time. Their venom is so potent that they have collectively destroyed the land in that area.
8116	The Red Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs that can be found [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] are coveted more for the sac itself, as opposed to the venom inside. Since it's a sac that holds that potent venom, the durability must be outstanding to say the least.
8117	It hasn't been long since I started studying the Blue Forest Mushroom Spiders found at [the region north of the giant snake mark and the region south of giant tree mark in Karu Forest]. At first, I thought they were just giant mutant spiders, but the more I studied them, the more I found out about these creatures. I have also realized that they are a legitimate threat to mankind here.
8118	Are you attracted to venoms? I know this is a bit random, but I do need some Blue Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs at [the region north of the giant snake mark and the region south of giant tree mark in Karu Forest]. Am I attracted to venoms? Maybe...
8119	Do you know why we humans are more superior to animals? That's because only humans can create and establish their own world. Do not hesitate to eliminate some animals in Iria. Head over to a region [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] and eliminate those Black Forest Mushroom Spiders that keep standing in the explorers' ways, and make this place a better place to live for us all!
8120	You know how the opposites attract? The venom sac from Black Forest Mushroom Spiders found [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] may contain potentially lethal poison, but the same poison can be used as an ingredient for a potion.
8121	Do you know [a place hidden in the valley between Muyu Desert and Karu Forest]? I got information that there is a hidden ruin, so I've been focusing on exploring the area, but I can't concentrate on my work because of the white kiwis lurking around. If anyone can help, could you get rid of the kiwis here?
8122	It seems that more and more people, especially those who have been to Iria, are looking for kiwi feathers. There's an interesting story going around that kiwi feathers bring the same good luck as a four-leaf clover. So, I'd like you to bring me just five white kiwi feathers from [a place hidden in the valley between Muyu Desert and Karu Forest].
8123	Defeat 10 Masked Goblins
8124	Have you seen a masked Goblin at [Karu Forest Ruins]? The mask is the only thing they wear, and they roam around with bare hands, giving the passing explorers a hard time or two. Please eliminate those Goblins.
8125	Defeat 10 Masked Goblin Archers
8126	Some of those masked Goblins even carry a bow with them. Some of the explorers that have not been used to combating against enemies with bows are having trouble inside [Karu Forest Ruins]. Please eliminate them whenever you see one.
8127	Defeat 10 Pot-Belly Spiders
8128	I hear that at [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a spider wearing a pot over its head. Those spiders are notorious for not letting go once they get a clean bite, so a lot of the explorers seem to be having trouble with them.
8129	Eliminate 10 Armoured Masked Goblins
8130	Have you seen Armored Masked Goblins in [Karu Forest Ruins]? If you run into any please don't ignore them, but eliminate them at once.
8131	Eliminate 10 Stone Hounds
8132	At the [Karu Forest Ruins], I hear that there's a stone statue that resembles a greyhound. Apparently, it has very sharp teeth and claws, making it tough for any explorer that crosses its path.
8133	Eliminate 10 Stone Bisons
8134	A moving stone sculpture that strongly resembles a cow, Stone Bison, is supposedly found at [Karu Forest Ruins]. They have a nasty streak that threatens the very safety of the explorers that visit the site, so I'm looking for someone brave enough to eliminate them for us.
8135	Eliminate 10 Stone Imps
8136	At the [Karu Forest Ruins], I hear that there's a stone statue called Stone Imp. If you run into one inside, please don't ignore them and eliminate them at first sight.

8140	A stone statue that looks like half bird and half horse, Stone Horse, is apparently found near [Karu Forest Ruins]. I heard they are there to protect the treasure of the ruins. Please eliminate those Stone Horses.
8141	Eliminate 10 Stone Horse Keepers
8142	Have you heard of a monster called Stone Horse Keeper, a creature with a human body and a bird head? They are apparently there to protect the treasures of [Karu Forest Ruins]. Please eliminate them for us.
8143	Eliminate 10 Gold Mask Ghosts
8144	I hear that around [Karu Forest Ruins], a ghost wearing a gold mask can be found from time to time. Please eliminate these pesky gold-masked ghosts that would just never let the passing explorers go.
8145	Eliminate 10 Skeleton Ghosts
8146	People have been telling me they have seen a Skeleton with a huge jaw at [Karu Forest Ruins]. These Skeletons are known for floating around waiting for someone to pass by, then attack them for no reason. Please eliminate these Skeleton Ghosts.
8147	Eliminate 10 Powerful Pot-Belly Spiders
8148	When you enter [a particular site of ruins in Karu Forest], you'll run into a Pot-Belly Spider that's even more powerful than most. They may look like a regular Pot-Belly Spider, but they are actually much tougher to defeat, so a lot of explorers seem to have trouble with them.

8157	Eliminate 1 Glowing Pot-Belly Spider
8158	I've heard that people who have been to the deepest parts of [Karu Forest Ruins] have witnessed there a Glowing Pot-Belly Spider. There's nothing more shocking to explorers than the sight of light from the middle of nowhere, and the light's origin is a mystery.
8159	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
8160	At [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a Stone Hound there that glows unlike others. No one knows exactly what it is, and since no one knows about it, it poses as a serious threat to explorers that visit the ruins.

8164	Glowing Stone Zombies are the most mysterious creatures you can ever find. No one knows anything about it, and so many people have visited the [Karu Forest Ruins] in hopes of figuring out the mysterious glow it produces. Most of them wound up never coming back out of the ruins.
8165	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Imp
8166	The term 'light' usually symbolizes purity, the power that drives away what is evil and corrupt in this world... but after seeing the Glowing Stone Imp first hand at [Karu Forest Ruins]... I realized that the opposite may be true as well.

8573	If you want to find hidden ruins, you'll need the help of an L-Rod.<br/>If you don't have an L-Rod yet,<br/>buy one I'm selling.<br/>It's an essential item for any explorer. <p/><image name='npctalk_l_rod' width='200' height='200' />The L-Rod is a special tool made from ore that reacts to magical powers and hides relics. <p/><image local='true' name='npctalk_searching_ruins' width='625' height='200' />When you walk around with this tool,<br/>if a hidden relic is nearby, it will emit light and sound in response. <br/>The closer you get, the bigger the reaction. <p/><image local='true' name='npctalk_searching_ruins' width='625' height='200' />While moving with the L-Rod,<br/>when you hear the four clicks accompanied by a light, press the X key to use the L-Rod.<br/>You can use the L-Rod's magical power to remove the spell that's hiding the relic. <p/>Then, take the L-Rod in both hands, leave the camp,<br/>and search for the stone bird statue pillars that were hidden by magic. <p/>The stone bird statue pillars are lined up all the way from the front of the camp to the center of the Flower Plain.
8574	Perhaps you went far away looking for the stone bird statue pillars? <br/>Going far away on business is fine because you have a purpose,<br/>but the journey back can be boring. <p/>At times like that, there is an item that can help you get back quickly. <br/>It's called Goddess Wings. I'll give one to <username/> as a gift. <p/>If you move the cursor over the Goddess Wings you just received,<br/>it will show previously visited locations as destinations. <br/>Right-click on the location and select "Use" to move to the destination. <br/>If used by a party leader, nearby party members can also move with you. <p/>Locations that can be traveled with Iria's Goddess Wings include<br/>Qilla Base Camp or the top of the last giant pattern you passed through. <p/>If the last location you passed through was a giant flower pattern,<br/>the place you can go to using Goddess Wings will be the giant flower pattern. <br/>If you want to return to camp, just avoid stepping on the giant pattern after leaving camp,<br/>and you can always return here. <p/>Hilbrin next to me sells Goddess Wings. <br/>Click the "Trade" button and select it from the "Magic Items" tab. <p/>I hope this information is useful to <username/>, an aspiring explorer. <br/>Don't rush, just learn a little bit at a time.
8575	Carved pillars are not that rare. <br/>There are many of them in the desert and plains, so you can easily find them. <p/>However, some of the pillars are unique, and they stand differently from the others in terms of their shape and patterns. <br/>What <username/> should look for is a pillar with clouds and rain carved into it. <p/>When you leave this camp, go along the Kaypi Canyon and look around you carefully. <p/>It's a very old pillar,<br/>broken and small, so don't miss it. <p/><show_dir pos='190515 205592' pitch='15'/>It's probably hard to understand just from the description, so<br/>I'll show you the direction of the pillar. <p/>Just follow the arrow and you should be able to find it easily.
8576	What kind of explorer would find this pillar with the flower field and bird carvings? <br/>The pillar is halfway between the base camp and the giant flower pattern. <p/>Between the base camp and the giant flower pattern, the Nubes Mountains rise, and the pillar is located to the east of those mountains. <p/>The pillar with the flower field and bird carvings is a curved pillar with a five-layer structure, so it should be easy to find. <p/>There are many mysterious things in Iria, but their meanings are not yet well known. <br/>What is the meaning of this pillar...<p/><show_dir pos='190150 241880' pitch='15'/>It'll be hard to find it just by listening to the description, so <br/>I'll show you the direction. <br/>Please move forward on the screen in the direction <br/>that <username/> is looking.
8577	Recently, a lot of people have been showing an interest in pillars, but I wonder if they are really that attractive. <p/>I know a pillar with carvings of people and flower fields, but it's a little way from here. <p/>If you've been to Muyu Desert, it's easy, but do you know that there is a path that leads to Muyu Desert if you go along Kaypi Canyon? <p/>If you head north without taking that path, you should see the pillar you're looking for. <p/>It's a collapsed two-story pillar, so try not to miss it. <p/><show_dir pos='232585 269953' pitch='15'/>It's probably hard to understand just by reading the description, so<br/>I'll show you the direction of the pillar. <p/>If you follow the arrow,<br/>you should be able to find it easily.
8578	I think the pillar with carvings of people, birds, and flower fields is a little hard to find. <p/>It's also because it's far from here<br/>there's nothing there to serve as a landmark. <p/>From the midpoint between the giant flower pattern and the giant man pattern<br/>go a little north and you'll find the pillar you're looking for among the trees. <br/>It's probably in the area where there are a lot of black-tailed mongooses...<p/>This pillar is a four-story pillar with the upper part collapsing, so you should be able to find it easily. <br/>I'm sorry I can't give you a detailed explanation, <br/>but I hope it goes well.
8579	There are a lot of people who are interested in the unique pattern,<br/>and it seems that there are quite a few scholars who are researching pillars and patterns. <p/>The pillar I'm looking for next is in the far northeast of Maiz Plains. <br/>If you go east from the giant man pattern, you'll start to see trees here and there,<br/>but if you go a little further, you should be able to find the pillar with clouds, rain, and birds painted on it surprisingly easily. <p/>It's a three-story pillar with the top part collapsing, so<br/>be careful not to pass it by. <p/>Looks really far and difficult? <br/>An explorer should be able to overcome this.
8580	The pillar with clouds, rain, and birds painted on it...<br/>That pillar is at the entrance to Muyu Desert. <br/>This pillar has five stories, but it's collapsed. <p/>Cross the valley from Maiz Plains to Muyu Desert,<br/>and head south along Kaipi Valley toward the Mana Tunnel,<br/>and you should find it at the halfway point. <p/>It's between the red soil and sand deserts,<br/>and apparently on one side you can only see a human face, and on the other side you can only see the face of the sun. <br/>Be careful not to pass it by just looking at one side. <p/>Unlike the plains, there are many animals in the desert that attack humans,<br/>so always be aware of your surroundings.
8581	I've researched it and all the desert pillars have a common sun pattern. <br/>The pillar we're looking for is one of them... <p/>It's in the middle of Muyu Desert,<br/>and adventurers complain that it's hard to find. <br/>It's in the lower part of the sand dunes, so you might have to look carefully from up high. <p/>You'll know it because each layer faces in a different direction. <p/>When you travel in the middle of Muyu Desert,<br/>beware of the aggressive animals hiding in the sand dunes.
8582	Are you talking about the pillar with the snake carving? <br/>Are you talking about the pillar far away from Muyu Desert? <p/>There's a four-layered pillar with snakes, sun, clouds and rain carved into it<br/>on the northern side of the desert. <br/>It's the only pillar with a snake pattern found so far. <p/>The snake carved pillar is located on the north side of Muyu Desert, not far from the giant four-legged animal pattern. <br/>Starting from the tail and butt of the giant four-legged animal pattern,<br/>you can only see the pillar if you go a little south.
8583	If you go beyond Muyu Desert, you will come to the lush Karu Forest. <br/>If you are an adventurer,<br/>it must be hard to find hidden ruins in the forest, right? <p/>Not only is it inconvenient to travel through the forest,<br/>but if you are attacked by a ferocious animal like an Asiatic black bear,<br/>it is often difficult to escape because you get caught in the trees. <p/>Oh, and the tree pattern pillar you are looking for is on the north side of the forest. <br/>It seems you can find it by going a little east from the Mana Tunnel in the north of Karu Forest and then going down south. <p/>The pillar has fallen,<br/>and it's hard to find because it's hidden by the trees in the forest. <p/>You'd better be careful because there are white Asiatic black bears and black-eared wild boars<br/>roaming around the pillar.
8584	Have you read the book about the legend of the giant bird? <br/>The story about the wall where the bird was trapped seems to be true...<br/>But where did this legend come from...? <br/>There's no explanation from the residents about the giant bird. <p/>It seems there is a giant bird pattern in the southern desert. <br/>It is usually said that there is a stone statue near the giant pattern. <br/>Could you investigate the ruins and see if there is anything related to the legend of the giant bird? <p/>The location of the giant bird pattern is... Do you know the three stone statues in the northern desert? <br/>Among them, if you head in the direction of the stone statue with a sharp head like a bird's beak,<br/>you will be able to find the bird trapped in the wall, and if you go past it<br/>to the end of the desert near the sea, you will find it. <p/>Go to the giant bird pattern in the southern desert and<br/>look for ruins related to the legend of the giant bird.
8585	The sketch is of a stone statue holding a sword...<br/>It's called a stone statue of a warrior. <br/>It may be possible to interpret it as a warrior slaying a giant bird,<br/>but it's not good to make assumptions without concrete evidence and follow the book's content. <p/>Other than that, there doesn't seem to be any evidence to prove the book's content. <br/>The ruins that glow at night have been confirmed,<br/>but with the additional stone statues of warriors that have been confirmed,<br/>it's a bit difficult to believe that the legend of the giant bird's resurrection is true. <p/>Thank you so much for traveling so far to investigate on my behalf.
8586	Have you read the book "Ancient Irian Messenger of God - Snakes"? <br/>According to that book, the ancient Irians<br/>believed snakes to be messengers of God and built snake temples. <p/>The author of the book says that somewhere in the south of the Karu Forest there is a picture of a snake drawn on the ground and the ruins of a temple around it. <br/>Could you please look into it to see if there is anything related to that temple? <p/>Actually, I've never heard of anyone seeing a temple in Iria before... <br/>I don't believe even half of what the book says. <p/><username/>If you look into it, we'll be able to find out if the story is true, <br/>or just a fantasy. <p/>If you go south from the three stone statues in the desert, you'll see a giant snake pattern on the ground. <br/>I want you to look for the stone statue nearby and the traces of the temple around it.
8587	We found a huge snake pattern on the ground and a new stone statue. <br/>It's a stone statue of a warrior I've never seen before...<br/>This statue isn't mentioned in the book, so it doesn't seem to be related to the legend of the snake temple. <p/>But the wall ruins with the snake carvings are quite different from what's in the book. <br/>Looking at the sketch you gave me, it's just a small part of the wall,<br/>but you've drawn it as if it were a temple and even imagined a god for the ancient Illian people...<p/>Sometimes explorers find ruins that don't exist, and<br/>some explorers overinterpret the ruins they find. <br/>This is one of the hardest parts of colonizing and exploring Illia. <br/>This is why I can't believe all the stories about exploration and legends. <p/>That's why I often ask <username/> to investigate. <br/>Do you know what I mean? <p/><username/>, please see and record as many things as you can with your own eyes. <br/>That's the most important thing for an explorer. <p/>Thank you for the accurate information. <br/>See you next time.
8588	If you head in the direction of the warrior statue, one of the three statues in the north desert, you will find a giant tree pattern deep in the eastern Karu Forest, near the Rutular River. <p/>Stone statues of great men, priests, and warriors have been found near the giant pattern on the ground. <br/>However, there have been no official reports of such statues being found near the giant tree pattern. <p/>According to rumors, it is hidden somewhere near the giant tree pattern and can be found occasionally. <br/>I would like to obtain a sketch to study its relationship with the other statues, but it seems that a special exploration using the L-rod is probably required. <p/>There is no particular report of the exploration, so since it is difficult to obtain materials,<br/>I would like you to find it, sketch it, and report back to us. <br/>Thank you, <username/>.
8589	Oh, you really did investigate the last stone statue. <br/>I thought it would take a long time, so I waited patiently. <p/>Even in an exploration that other adventurers cannot immediately set foot in,<br/><username/> easily does it! <br/>I think you have a sense for exploration. <p/>The stone statue you sketched is of a great man with his hands behind his back. <br/>This means I have collected all the materials related to stone statues. <br/>We need someone to analyze them so that the efforts of the explorers are not wasted. <p/>I think it will take a long time to reveal the true identity and meaning of the stone statues standing on the Iria continent, but with <br/><username/> together,<br/>I feel like we can continue to have fun. <p/>If you get any new information, please let me know right away. <br/>I'm looking forward to it.

8606	True Purpose of the Twin Sword
8607	Evidence of the Twin Swords can be found at various artifacts and ruins in Iria. It states that when a warrior holds swords in both hands, that's when the warrior turns into a true powerful being. Maybe if we look into their we will learn more about their skills. \n - Nicca -

8643	<username/>, you are also looking for the Sacred Grail. <br/>Several explorers have brought the book and visited the Karu Forest many times. <p/>Most of the Forest Mushroom Spiders, who have poison sacs to collect in the book, are found in the south of the Karu Forest. <p/>The Brown Forest Mushroom Spider and the Red Forest Mushroom Spider are found near the giant snake pattern, <br/>The Blue Forest Mushroom Spider is found above the giant snake pattern and below the giant tree pattern. <p/>The Black Forest Mushroom Spider is found in the east of the Karu Forest, near the giant tree pattern. <p/>The spiders don't have many skills, but <br/>you have to be careful because they will take a lot of damage if they attack you.
8644	You have completed the book and received the Sacred Grail, right? <br/>Then all you have to do is fill the Grail with water. <p/>Some people brought the Sacred Grail and complained. <br/>They couldn't get water from the well, and neither could they find water on the beach. <p/>Even after all the trouble they went through to get the Sacred Cup,<br/>some explorers are left feeling lost and confused about what to do with it. <p/>According to legend, the Sacred Cup<br/>can only hold special water,<br/>and apparently the water that falls from an ancient ruin in the Karu Forest<br/>enters the cup. <p/>Take the Sacred Cup to the Karu Forest and<br/>find a ruin with flowing water and investigate it.

8649	Somewhere [south of the giant bird mark in the desert, near the ocean], a monument is hidden with a sun drawn on it.

8655	I'd like you to find the Sun Stone and investigate it, <username/>. <br/>The Sun Stone is said to be about the height of an adult, with a face blowing wind. <p/>It can be found with an L-Rod along the southern coast of Muyu Desert, <br/>but its exact location is unknown. <p/>According to some people, <br/>when the weather is good, it looks like a normal stone, <br/>but when it starts to rain, a glowing pattern appears. <p/>Iria has more sunny days than rainy days, <br/>so you should sketch the glowing stone on a rainy day first.
8656	Thank you for traveling so far to investigate. <br/>It rarely rains in Iria, so it must have taken a lot of patience to sketch the glowing stone. <p/>I'm sorry to trouble you, but<br/>on a clear day after the rain, could you<br/>sketch the monument featuring the sun again? <p/>I'll give you a generous reward for your trouble.
8657	Good job. <br/>You endured the wait and achieved your goal. <p/>I believe the patience and perseverance you've shown<br/>will help you become an even greater explorer in the future.

8668	Do you know about the cloud monument?<br/>Many people confuse it with the sun monument because it looks similar,<br/>but you have to look closely to find it.<p/>It has the same pattern of a face blowing wind,<br/>but the difference is that instead of the sun, clouds are drawn between the sawtooth patterns.<p/>There's a forest on the north side of Muyu Desert,<br/>so you should be able to find it by investigating nearby with the L-rod.<p/>According to some people,<br/>like the sun monument,<br/>it appears as a normal monument on a sunny day,<br/>but on rainy days, a glowing pattern appears.<p/>First, go to the north side of the desert on a rainy day and<br/>sketch the monument with the glowing pattern.
8669	Iria doesn't get many rainy days, so it must have taken a long time to investigate.<p/>Good job, <username/>. <p/>There's a lot of research to be done at the Shining Pattern Ruins,<br/>so I'd like you to do another research. <p/>This time, I'd like you to sketch the cloud-featured monument on a sunny day. <br/>It's almost always sunny in Iria, so I think it'll be easy. <p/>Good luck with your next job. <br/>Please draw the cloud-featured monument on the north side of Muyu Desert on a sunny day.
8670	Sorry for making you go so far away so many times. <br/>But sometimes it's better to check the results in between tasks<br/>to reduce unnecessary work...<p/>I hope my reward will give you some comfort, <username/>.

8682	Oh... so that's a dragon's footprint!<br/>It's too big to be a living thing. <p/>I'm also really curious about the story that dragons are guarding mountains of treasure,<br/>but dragon claws, scales, and bones<br/>are also very valuable materials for making weapons and armor. <p/>I heard that dragons disappear before they die,<br/>but I can't help thinking that<br/>"Maybe someone who found the corpse actually took everything away?"<br/><p/>Anyway, now I have one more thing to do in Iria. <br/>Excavating ruins is good, but dragon hunting looks like it'll be pretty profitable. <br/>Thanks!

8693	Desert sandstorms...<br/>I can't say for sure that dragons are responsible for such natural phenomena. <p/>However, I have heard some people say that they have seen a huge shadow passing by on the Kaipi Valley plateau, accompanied by a sharp cry. <p/>Whether it was a dragon or not will be clear if <username/> investigates it himself. <p/>By the way, there have been reports that large unidentified footprints are sometimes found in the Kaipi Valley plateau area.
8694	Very few animals can leave such large footprints...<br/>I wonder if there is any other animal that can leave such deep and large footprints, other than a giant dragon? <p/>Dragons have been known since ancient times as immortal creatures. <br/>Even if they die, dragons who realize their death is near will hide in deep caves or craters, so they are never seen dead. <p/>There is almost nothing that can stop a dragon, whose entire body is covered in scales that can deflect swords and bows. <p/>However, I have heard that dragons react to certain music... <br/>Well, it's just a rumor, so I don't know the details. <p/>If you happen to come across a dragon while searching for dragon traces like this time, run away as far as you can before it notices you. <br/>What an explorer needs is wise judgment, not reckless courage.

8700	Based on my research, Cactus Lizard is basically a cactus drawing the lizard in, and attach itself onto the back of the lizard. This also means when the lizard dies, the cactus will find another lizard to latch on to... to make sure this is true, I want you to find 10 Cactus Lizards [all around the central part of Muyu Desert] and eliminate them, then see if any change occurs.

8783	Oh. You're back. How's fox hunting going? <br/>It's not that difficult, is it? <p/>You'll attack with a bow from a long distance. <br/>You should have some leeway. <p/>However, when facing an opponent stronger than you,<br/>even an elf will often not be able to take them down with just one or two arrows. <p/>Opponents that don't fall even after being hit by an arrow<br/>will immediately retaliate, so it will be a close-quarters battle. <br/>...We elves are weak in close-quarters combat like this. <p/>Therefore, you will need to learn about close combat later. <br/>But wouldn't it be better for you to have a technique that can kill in one hit? <p/>When you complete this quest,<br/>you will get the Magnum Shot, which can deal great damage in one shot and send your opponent flying. <br/>Practice it until you get used to it.
8784	Magnum Shot, a Powerful Blow
8785	Even if you strike your enemy with two arrows, if you can't knock it down, then it will come rushing back at you. If you master Magnum Shot, a skill that allows you to knock down an enemy with a single arrow, then you won't have to worry about that - Castanea

8787	Defeat 5 Young Grey Armadillos
8788	Report to Castanea
8789	Use the Magnum Shot skill I taught you to kill the five baby armadillos<br/>below the village. <p/>However, you are still new to the skill, so one Magnum Shot<br/>may seem weaker than two regular arrows. <p/>What you should practice on this hunt<br/>is not to take down your opponent with one shot, but to use the Magnum Shot<br/>to send your opponent flying far away,<br/>and then maintain a suitable distance while you launch your next attack. <p/><show_dir pos='352091 400219' pitch='15'/>The baby armadillos<br/>should be at the bottom of the hill below the village. Go and try.
8790	How about the Magnum Shot? <br/>You may not feel the need for it because its power is still weak...<br/>but as you gradually fight stronger opponents and get to know the flow of battle,<br/>you will understand why it is so important. <p/>Oh... that's right.<br/>I will teach you one more unusual action that only we elves can use. <p/>Try pressing the 'Action' button at the bottom of the screen. <br/>Hide, pretend to be dead, perform... there are various actions, right? <p/>Among them, 'Hide' is a skill only elves can use to hide from others by consuming mana. <p/>After you have finished talking with me, try clicking the 'Use' button<br/>next to the Hide skill in the 'Action Window'. <br/>Your body will instantly become invisible. <p/>If you want to cancel it, just press it again. <br/>As for the other skills I haven't taught you,<br/>try using them at least once to see their effects.
8791	Drawing Water
8792	Did you find yourself running out of Stamina when using Magnum Shot? You'll need to know that everything you use a skill or a weapon, you'll be using up a little bit of your stamina. Atrata is in need of some water, so take this bottle and fill it up, and give it to Atrata. -Castanea

8796	When you were training your Magnum Shot,<br/>you probably ran out of stamina<br/>and couldn't use your skills continuously, right? <p/>It's not just Magnum Shot. <br/>When you use each skill,<br/>or attack with a weapon,<br/>stamina is consumed. <p/>If you don't have enough stamina during battle,<br/>you'll inevitably be hit by your opponent's counterattack... <br/>And that's not all. There may be times when you have to run away<br/>until your stamina recovers... <p/>Atrata also sells potions that restore stamina. <br/>Visit her and hear her explanation. <p/>Oh... now that I think of it, Atrata<br/>needed water. <br/>Hey, it's a bit of a hassle,<br/>but could you go get some water and bring it to Atrata? <p/><image name='npctalk_draw_water'/>Hold the empty bottle I gave you earlier in your right hand,<br/>and hold nothing in your left hand<br/>and go to the well near the field on the east side of the village. <p/><image name='npctalk_draw_water'/>When you place the cursor over the well,<br/>it will turn into a bottle,<br/>and then click on the well. <br/>You will then be able to fill the empty bottle with water.

8813	Oh? Did you ask Castanea for this...?<br/>So you brought it for me.<br/>Thank you, <username/>! <p/>That's right... Castanea asked you to learn close combat<br/>skills from me.<br/>Hmm...where should I start... <p/>Castanea taught you a lot about bow combat<br/>didn't she? <p/>I'm sure you understand, but with a bow, you've probably been counterattacked before you could prepare your next arrow, haven't you? <p/>In those cases, you can run away and wait for another chance to attack---but<br/>if possible, I think it's better to press the Tab key to switch to a weapon other than a bow and fight with your bare hands or a weapon. <p/>So, fight an enemy with your bare hands or a weapon right away, and<br/>raise your attack skill to F rank. <p/>Oh. I know you know this, but<br/>hitting trees, signs, and other stationary objects<br/>isn't good practice, right? <p/><show_dir pos='371660 402404' pitch='15'/>Well...go all the way down to the bottom of the hill below the village and try to kill about five young black armadillos without using a bow. <p/>After fighting for a while,<br/>when your attacks reach F rank,<br/>come back to me.
8814	Welcome back. How was it? <br/>Close combat is a little difficult when you try it, isn't it? <br/>Unlike bows, you attack once and then...are attacked,<br/>and then the cycle repeats over and over, which is the biggest feature of close combat. <p/>But you won't be able to hold on if you just take the opponent's attacks, right? <br/>That's where the basics of close combat - defense skills - come in! <br/>If you use defense skills before you take the opponent's attack,<br/>you can minimize damage and counterattack immediately. <p/>It's a skill you'll use often even if you mainly use a bow,<br/>so I recommend you register it as a shortcut key on the screen and use it. <p/>Oh, don't worry about the skills. <br/>I'll teach you. <br/>Okay? Once you know how to do it,<br/>just keep practicing until you get it right!!<p/>So, when you complete this quest,<br/>I'll give you a book about defense.<br/>Please refer to it when you have any questions.

Try practicing how to use the defense skill against the young brown tail mongooses on the eastern side of the village. Use defense as immediately after you attack to prevent it from hurting you. - Meles

8819	Report to Meles
8820	Attack then defend, attack then defend. <br/>Simple but the most typical fighting method! <br/>The opponent will also use defense to defend against our attacks. <p/>Well, we have bows and arrows,<br/>so even if the opponent uses defense,<br/>it's more like saying "hurry up and attack with your bow"<br/>hehe. <p/>But just in case we run out of arrows<br/>and are forced into close combat,<br/>we need to know how to break through the opponent's defense! <p/>A powerful skill to break through defense in close combat,<br/>that's it! Exactly!! It's the smash skill I just taught you! <p/>Gather all your strength and unleash a powerful blow<br/>that breaks through the enemy's defense...! Mmm, it's awesome!!<br/>It'll be a sight to see the opponent fly away when you hit it well. <p/>Right. Depending on how you look at it, it looks similar to a magnum shot from a bow. <p/>It doesn't have to be right now<br/>Try learning it when you have time.

8832	Talk to Meles
8833	How is it? Are you continuing to practice your defense? <br/>Today, I came to teach you a really cool skill called Windmill. <br/>It's easy to remember! But to master it, you really need to practice! <br/>Okay? Practice! Study! That's all there is to it!!<br/>Get ready!!<p/>(Ahem)...Um, well. <p/>The Windmill is, to put it simply...<br/>You lower your waist, spin around at a low position, and attack all enemies within a certain range.<br/>It's a super skill! <p/>Oh. But it drains your stamina<br/>every time you use it, so don't use it too much. <p/>Well, you'll see when you try it. <br/>Well... you can't expect much power until you get used to it, so I think it's a good idea to practice on a young armadillo first. <p/><show_dir pos='371660 402404' pitch='15'/>Do you know where the young armadillos are? <br/>I think you'll find them if you go all the way down to the bottom of the village.
8834	The key to using the Windmill is, above all else, location!! Location! <br/>...that's all there is to it. <p/>In fact, it's more effective to use it in a small space like a dungeon where there are a lot of enemies packed together than in a wide place like the desert! <p/>Oh! And what's more!!<br/>While you're using the Windmill, you become invincible and won't be hit by any attacks from enemies! <br/>How's that? Isn't it amazing? <p/>...But once the Windmill attack is over, you'll be defenseless for a while, so you need to think carefully about when and where to use it.
8835	First Aid and Resurrection
8836	If you are injured in a battle, the amount of health you can heal is lowered. I can treat these injuries, but you won't be so lucky if you are far from town, or inside of a dungeon. I can teach you a skill called First Aid that will help you heal your injuries yourself - Atrata

8843	Report to Meles
8844	Hehe. It looks like you're starting to look a bit more like an elven warrior. <br/>Now then, I'll teach you about the Counter Attack skill, which uses the enemy's close-range attacks to counterattack! <p/>As I just said, Counter Attack is a skill that uses the enemy's attack power. <br/>So you can't use it unless the enemy attacks you at close range. <p/>If the enemy attacks with a bow or magic, <br/>this skill is completely useless, so keep that in mind. <p/><show_dir pos='405905 429298' pitch='15'/>Well, let's get practicing! <br/>Well... there should be a young brown-tailed mongoose near the top of the east side of the village where we fought in defense training before... <br/>That would be a perfect opponent for practicing Counter Attack. <p/>For now, I think <br/><username/> will get the hang of it after about three tries. <br/>Well, good luck!
8845	Thank you for coming all the way! <br/>How about it? Was it difficult to time your counterattack? <br/>When mongooses are attacked, they run over and counterattack immediately, so they're a good opponent to practice against. <p/>Well, I think you've learned this by trying it out, but <br/>if the opponent mainly uses long-distance attacks or magic, <br/>counterattacks aren't very useful. <br/>You understand that, right? <p/>In other words, when you're fighting, you have to decide which skills you have to use according to the opponent's attack pattern... <br/>don't forget that you'll need tactics like that.
8846	Try Repair
8847	It's important that you equip yourself with good weapons and armors, but it's just as important to take care of the and fix them if needed. I am sure your weapons are worn out by now from all that training, so how about you let me help you repair them? - Meles
8848	Talk to Meles
8849	Have Meles repair a weapon
8850	Whatever you use over and over, its durability will decrease and it will become unusable. <br/>Of course, the same goes for weapons! <p/>If you fight with a weapon whose durability has decreased, <br/>it could lead to a disaster during battle, you know? <br/>So, make it a habit to check how worn out your weapon is and <br/>repair it as needed. <p/>If you continue to use it when its durability has decreased... <br/>Even if Castanea forgives you, I won't! <br/>Okay? Repair it frequently! ? <p/>By the way...I can repair weapons, but<br/>if you want clothes...you can ask Lepus at the clothing store over there! <p/>...I hate to say it, but he's better at that sort of thing. <br/>Ah! Just so you know,<br/>I can sew a little too!? <p/>(Ahem)...Then, when this conversation is over, would you mind letting me repair any weapon you have? <br/>If none of your weapons seem to have low durability,<br/>then fight a few more times and come back when they're low on durability.

8856	Wow, those firewood look very sturdy. <br/>Thanks to you, I think I can repair the exploration quest board. <br/>As a thank you, I'll teach you the campfire skill. <p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>To use a campfire, you first<br/>need five pieces of firewood. <br/>If you have the necessary firewood, you can start a fire, but it would be a problem if there were people or things around you, right? <p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>If you make a campfire and sit around it to rest,<br/>your vitality, stamina, and injuries will recover a little faster. <p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>And if you sit around the campfire and eat food,<br/>you can share food with other people in camp sharing. <br/>Try to enjoy interacting with the people around you while you take a break.

8863	You did a good job. <br/>The Eye of the Sun is a ruin that remains in its usual place,<br/>so I think you could have easily found it and sketched it. <p/>However, many of the ruins on the continent of Konnus are<br/>hidden by magic and must be found with the L-Rod,<br/>and when found, must be quickly sketched before they disappear. <p/>If I have the chance later,<br/>I will teach you how to use the L-Rod to find hidden ruins.

8869	Hmm...

8912	Beginners with little practical experience<br/>are in a hurry<br/>and many of them try to go to the desert right away. <p/>Then they are attacked by the ghost desert warriors near the red sand scorpion...<br/>and most of them just come back to the village. <br/>Well, I understand their hurry...<br/>They don't know the horrors of the desert yet. <br/>There's no point in blaming them too much, right? <p/>So I have a favor to ask of you. <br/>Hehe... you get it now, don't you? <br/>Of course! Defeat the five ghost desert warriors!!<p/>...Okay, okay. Don't make that face. <p/>Okay? The ghosts are near the red sand scorpion<br/>and have thick swords and shields, so I think you'll know right away. <br/>But don't underestimate them. <br/>They're so strong that they can be incapacitated after just a few hits. <p/>Well... avoid close combat as much as possible...<br/>Using the elf's speed, I think it's best to keep a reasonable distance and attack from a distance with a bow.
8913	<username/> saved me! <br/>Lots of beginner elves<br/>seem really happy too. <br/>Thank you so much! <p/>That's right. From now on, <username/> will also be going deeper and deeper into the desert, right? <br/>But it's inconvenient because you can't use the mana tunnel at night, right? <br/>So! I'll give you something nice. <p/>...Here. Just one... the wings of the goddess. <br/>With these, you can instantly travel to the last place you visited<br/>. <p/>To find out where you're going, place the cursor over the Goddess' Wing in your inventory,<br/>and the last place you visited will be registered as your destination,<br/>so check there. <p/>If the party leader uses it, nearby party members can<br/>move as well. <p/>Places you can travel to with the Goddess' Wing in Connous Desert are<br/>here in Filia... and any giant pattern that <username/> has been to at least once. <p/>Castanea sells Goddess' Wings,<br/>so it's a good idea to keep one or two on you at all times.
8914	The Giant Underground Maze in Connous Desert
8915	When you dig up sand in the desert, there will be times when you fall into a cavernous, complex cave called the Underground Maze. Finding your way out of the maze will be a good experience for you - Meles
8916	Conversation with Meles
8917	Escape from the Underground Tunnel in Longa Desert
8918	Report to Meles
8919	Under the white sand of the desert, sometimes there are holes in the sand that lead to underground mazes. <br/>Once you step in by mistake, it's over...<br/>and it's not so easy to get out. <p/>Well, there's no need to be so pessimistic. <br/>It's true that it's long and complicated,<br/>but it's not a place that you can't get out of. <br/>It might be a good idea to go in and test your skills. <p/>...Ah. That said, the boss in the middle of the cave is<br/>super strong, so if you do enter the maze,<br/>don't even think about fighting the boss, okay? <br/>Just keep in mind that you'll get out on your own, okay?
8920	Hehe. It seems like you can solve most problems<br/>by yourself now! <br/>Just believe in your own strength and enjoy your adventures. <br/>Of course, don't neglect your training, okay?
8921	Advice from Castanea
8922	It looks like you have become a much stronger independent Elf. You should come see me. - Castanea -

8925	Eliminate Green Horn Cobra
8926	Recently the cobras around Rupes Desert are raging. Their bite is very toxic and it is an increasing danger to elves passing through. Please get rid of Green Horn Cobras and I will reward you well. \n - Hagel -
8927	Eliminate 1 Green Horn Cobra
8928	Eliminate Desert Rhinos
8929	Desert Rhinos have been blocking access to the Neres Plateau. They are usually docile but the adults have been aggressive lately. Please get rid of Desert Rhinos and I will reward you. \n  - Castanea -
8930	Eliminate Desert Rhinos
8931	Eliminate King Connous Lizard
8932	Why don't you try eliminating some of the connous lizards there in Longa? You should be strong enough. \n - Meles -
8933	Eliminate King Connous Lizard
8934	Conversation with Meles
8935	The Connous Giant Lizard is the representative animal of the Connous. <br/>So, fighting it one-on-one and winning is the best proof that you've become a great warrior!
8936	Try Upgrading
8937	Have you found a good weapon? Weapons can be upgraded to increase their strength. Ask Meles to upgrade a weapon for you, and then come visit me at my house. - Castanea -
8938	Conversation with Meles
8939	Have Meles Upgrade a Weapon
8940	Speak with Castanea
8941	Do you want me to modify your weapon? <br/>Hehe... leave it to me when it comes to weapon modification! <br/>Even though it's just a word, "modification" you can choose the type and level to suit your fighting style! <p/>Also, to modify, you need not only money but also weapon proficiency. <br/>Well, it's quicker to try it out for yourself. <p/>So, talk to me and click 'Modify'<br/>Choose a suitable weapon from the weapons I can modify...<br/>Dagger, Short Sword, Short Bow, Long Bow<br/>and request a modification. <p/>Oh. And I'll give you this too. <br/>Modification Guidebook. I think it will be useful.
8942	Oh... welcome. It's <username/>. <br/>It seems that you've become a full-fledged worker. <br/>When I think back to when you first came here...<br/>I'm pleased to see how much you've grown...<br/>I think you should go beyond Konnus and visit the continents of Rano and Uladh, where humans live. <p/>If you can learn something from the humans that we elves don't have,<br/>it will be a much more valuable experience for you...
8943	Gathering Wool
8944	I will teach you the weaving skill. Please gather 5 wool from the sheep outside of the village. They will be used to make thick thread. - Lepus -
8945	Speak with Lepus
8946	Give 5 Wool to Lepus
8947	Place 5 cobwebs on a spinning wheel and make 1 thin thread
8948	Give 1 Thin Thread to Lepus
8949	Take the gathering knife I'll give you and shear 5 pieces of wool from the sheep in the fields to the east of the village. <p/>When shearing the wool, hold the knife in your right hand and don't hold anything in your left hand.
8950	Thank you. <br/>You've done a great job shearing 5 pieces of wool. <p/>You can use the spinning wheel next to me to make thread from spider silk and wool. <br/>As a thank you for bringing me the wool, I'll teach you the weaving skill. <p/>Even with the practice rank of the weaving skill I taught you earlier, you can spin thick thread from wool, but you'll probably fail a lot. <p/>Now, go to the giant lizard pattern in the upper right corner of the village and pick up 5 pieces of spider silk dropped by spiders. <br/>You can bring a little extra just in case you fail. <p/>Put 5 spider silk into a spinning wheel and spin it to create<br/>thin thread. <br/>Use the spinning wheel to spin 1 thin thread from the spider silk.
8951	It was hard to make thin thread, right? <br/>The thread you make this way<br/>can be used to make beautiful clothes. <p/>You can use the spinning wheel anytime, so<br/>whenever you get some spider silk or wool,<br/>be sure to use it.
8952	Eliminate Connous Lizard
8953	Hmmm... Have you been training hard with Combat Mastery? You look like you're comfortable engaging in melee combats. Then how about facing a Connous Lizard 1 on 1? If you beat the lizard, then I'll give you a small gift. - Meles -
8954	Eliminate 1 Connous Lizard
8955	Report to Meles
8956	Connous Lizards have a simple nature! <br/>Really, they're simple-minded... <p/>Well, that makes them an easy enemy to fight, but <br/>their stamina and attack power are super high, <br/>so even a small mistake can cause a lot of damage. <p/>In particular, if you miss your bow even once, you're out!! <br/>The best way to deal with these enemies is to fight them in close combat, like <username/>! <br/>You did well! I wonder if it was because of my teaching methods? <p/>Hehe. Just kidding, just kidding. This is also the result of <username/>'s hard work! <p/>So, this is my congratulations. <br/>Keep practicing!
8957	Deadly Strike, Smash Training
8958	Smashing for a preemptive attack is nice, but if possible, a one-hit kill would be easier, right? If you practice a bit more and reach [Smash rank 8], I'll give you something great! \n - Meles -
8959	Reach rank 8 Smash
8960	Counterattack is the greatest attack
8961	I hear that your Counterattack skill has improved dramatically these days. If you really know how to use that skill, that would make your battles that much easier to win. Bring you Counterattack skill to Rank 9, and I will give you something that you will find very useful. - Meles -
8962	Reach rank 9 Counterattack
8963	Desert Storm, Windmill
8964	When I use Windmill on the desert sand, it sometimes looks like a small tornado shoots up towards the enemy! Of course, it's just as powerful as a tornado! If you reach [Windmill rank 9], I'll give you something great! \n - Meles -
8965	Reach rank 9 Windmill
8966	Hunt White Kiwi
8967	It seems you've gotten used to using a bow. Did you know? A bow is also good for hunting? Why don't you try hunting a [White Kiwi] on the southeast coast of Filia? \n - Castanea -
8968	Hunt White Kiwi
8969	Magnum Shot Training
8970	It seems you have been practicing Magnum Shot without fail. With that much training, it will be easy to kill someone with one hit. When you reach [Magnum Shot rank 9], I will give you a present. \n - Castanea -
8971	Reach rank 9 Magnum Shot
8972	A small candle that turns darkness into light
8973	All healers, myself included, find great joy in helping others. To see that your Healing skill has reached a high level means that you've healed a significant number of others yourself. If you train all the way up to [Rank 9 Healing], then I will give you a small present.<br/>- Atrata -
8974	Reach rank 9 healing
8975	Music Research
8976	Are you interested in music? I think I can help you a bit in this... Raise your Instrument Playing skill to D and I will give you a book that'll help you understand music a little better. - Granites -
8977	Reach Playing Instrument rank D
8978	Report to Granites
8979	It's a human book that's hard to come by here. <br/>If you have even the slightest interest in music, it should be useful. <p/>It seems that humans organize and develop music in a more systematic way than we elves, who enjoy music at our whim.
8980	Composition Training
8981	I heard you've been working hard to compose better songs. When you're still in the learning phase, it's not a bad idea to use someone else's music for practice. Practice until you reach Rank E, then I, Granites, will give you a blank music score scroll as gift. - Granites -
8982	Reach Composition rank E
8983	Report to Granites
8984	When I composed my first piece, I wrote the score hundreds of times and stayed up all night. <p/>Looking at the score now,<br/>I can see how childish it was, but I can also feel the passion I had back then. <p/>I'll give you the blank score as a sign of encouragement...<br/>If you become a great composer,<br/>please write a song for me. <username/>
8985	Nele's Present
8986	I am 'Loeiz', the author of 'The History of Erinn Music' volumes 1 and 2. Thank you for buying my book. It would be a great delight to me if you read my book and increase your music skills. I don't know when it will be, but if you train your Musical Knowledge skill to rank A, I will give you my new book and another present. - Loeiz -
8987	Reach Musical Knowledge rank A
8988	Care of Fire
8989	Hello, this is Hagel. Are you making good use of campfires? If you'd like, I'd like to give you some tips. Please stop by and I'll give you a copy of [A book that will help you improve your campfire rank]. \n- Hagel -
8990	Speak with Hagel
8991	Hello, <username/>. <br/>I called you here because I wanted to give you some tips on making a campfire. <p/>First of all, when you start a fire, you need to look around carefully. <br/>You don't want anything nearby that could catch fire. <p/>After you've finished making the fire, make sure it's completely out. <br/>Even if there's only a little smoke coming out, <br/>there may still be some embers left in the ashes. <p/>Once you're sure it's completely out, don't forget to clean up properly so as not to get in the way of people passing by. <p/>Here, I'll give you a book. <br/>I hope this helps you have a fun trip.
8992	Hat Delivery
8993	Hi I'm Lepus from the Clothing Shop. I have a running back-order for Wizard Hats which is why I need your help! I realize you may not be able to deliver this request as it is coming so last-minute but would you be so kind as to bring me 30 Wizard Hats and I will pay you back generously? Watch out, though, since I will only take items that are made by individuals with a Tailoring skill Rank of B or above. - Lepus -

9000	Thank you very much!<br/>I'll give you the material fee for the time being, and after the work is finished I'll repay you.<br/>Thank you for the remaining 10 as well.
9001	Thank you very much. <br/>I really appreciate you accepting my unreasonable request. <br/>I will contact you again if there is anything else I would like to ask of you.
9002	Weaving Training
9003	I hear that you are much better at extracting threads and making fabric now. Lately we've had a sudden increase in the number of explorers here, and I have been getting a lot of requests on robes. Unfortunately, we have been short on common fabric, so I'd like to ask you for some help. Please complete Rank A of Weaving skill and then make 10 pieces of common fabric for me. I will definitely make it worthwhile for you. - Lepus -
9004	Reach Weaving rank A
9005	Create 10 common fabrics
9006	Deliver 10 common fabrics to Lepus
9007	Thank you. <br/>I'm glad you were able to get everything you needed even though it was a sudden request. <p/>I've prepared a gift for you as a thank you for listening to my request. <br/>You can receive your reward once you complete the quest.
9008	Reach level 20
9009	You are almost at Level 20. I realize that you'd busy learning various things all at once, but keep training. There's a present for you once you reach Level 20, so find me. - Atrata -
9010	Reach level 20
9011	Speak with Atrata
9012	...So you've reached level 20...! <br/>I'm glad to hear that you're in good health. <br/>Exploring and fighting are great, but if you have the time, <br/>I think it would be a good idea to try out the various things you can do in the village... <p/>Spinning, cooking, etc... There are many things you'll find fun in once you try them out...
9013	Reach level 30
9014	Combat is not the only way to making yourself grow as a bonafide Elf. It is just as important to venture into new worlds and take on new challenges. Please come see me when you've reached Level 30. - Hagel -
9015	Reach level 30
9016	Speak with Hagel
9017	Repeated battles can get boring.<br/>When that happens, try looking for a new place.<br/>There are many mysterious ruins and dungeons hidden in a place called Rano,<br/>across the desert of Konnus.<p/>We have prepared a gift for you to help you on your adventure.
9018	Reach level 40
9019	This is Castanea. I have heard of your accomplishments through other elves. I understand that you are busy, but when you reach level 40, please come see me. It will not take long. -Castanea-
9020	Reach level 40
9021	Speak with Castanea
9022	Well done, <username/>. <br/>You've grown so much in the blink of an eye. <br/>It feels like just yesterday that I first met you... <p/><username/>. It's good to train hard and become stronger, but<br/>how are you getting on with the others? <br/>That's all I was wondering about...that's why I came to see you. <p/>It's good to train yourself,<br/>but it's better not to think that you can master everything by yourself, you know? <br/>Look around you carefully. Then you'll find not only friends with a common goal, but also friends with whom you can truly share your heart. <p/>I hope that you'll meet friends with whom you can walk and live together.
9023	Coming of Age Ceremony

9026	How much time has passed since I met you... Before I knew it, you had become a fine adult. <br/>It is truly a joyous occasion. <p/>At this turning point of becoming an adult, are you looking clearly at your future? <br/>When you become an adult, you will be freed from the various ties you have had up until now,<br/>but in return, you will be burdened with the responsibilities of an adult. <p/>From now on, more than ever, you must determine what you should do,<br/>and live your life without regrets. <p/>Oh... that's right. Nao gave me a bouquet of flowers to celebrate your coming of age. <br/>Hehe...<username/>. It seems Nao likes you. <br/>When you meet again, don't forget to thank him.
9027	A Fine Adult
9028	Do you feel like time just flies by the more you grow old? It looks like you have reached another milestone now, turning 30. I have something for you, some [sic] come by. - Hagel -
9029	Speak with Hagel
9030	Time flies when you live your life to the fullest. <br/><username/>, you've turned 30 before you knew it. <br/>Your life up until now has been fun... of course. <p/>They say that as you get older, your perspective on the world broadens. <br/>That's because you have more experiences and your relationships with people broaden. <br/>But as you get older, I think it's good to have some time for yourself sometimes. <p/>I don't know if you'll like it, but<br/>I'll give you a bottle of wine as a gift<br/>to show you that it's important to have the time to enjoy a drink slowly.
9031	Life from here on out
9032	Has the time really gone this fast? I am guessing you may be showing your age now. Haha... I have a special present for you, for all the help you have given me over the years. If you are interested, please stop by. - Granites -
9033	Speak with Granites
9034	Oh, you're 40 too! Congratulations, <username/>. <br/>But even though you're 40,<br/>your face doesn't look that old. <br/>You're still in your late 30s, I guess? Haha. <br/>Anyway, from now on, always take care of your health. <br/>...So, accept my gift with gratitude.

10186	Longa Desert Ruins Dungeon
10187	At the foot of the hill below the village of Philia, a dungeon of desert ruins is hidden. Why don't you experience the dungeon soon? Clear the dungeon of the ruins in the Longa Desert! Why don't you try it? \n --Meles-
10188	Speak with Meles
10189	Clear a Longa Desert Ruins Dungeon
10190	Speak with Meles
10191	Unlike fighting out in the fields, when you fight in a dungeon, you're in a small space against multiple enemies. You should adjust your strategies accordingly. <p/>While it's not difficult to overcome a dungeon, you may want to have other people join you in clearing the dungeon. <p/><image name='npctalk_connous_ruin_entrance' width='180' height='180'/> The Longa Desert Dungeon is under Filia, but you usually have to find it using an L-rod. However, once you find it, it will be marked on your map, making it much easier to visit again. <p/>Once you have found the entrance, enter it and drop an item on the momunment, anything you want, and you will enter the dungeon. <p/>The boss may be a bit difficult, but... Well, I expect you will be fine. Good luck!
10192	Oh? You've cleared the dungeon? I suppose this dungeon is too easy for you... <p/>Oh, that's right. If you drop the arrow that the dungeon's boss drops, you can enter a special dungeon, which has stronger enemies. <p/>At your current level, though, it may be a little bit too difficult. Why don't you, when you get more experience and become stronger, try to clear it? <p/>Anyways, good work clearing the dungeon.
10193	Sketch Longa's Lighthouse
10194	When you head south of the Mana Tunnel of Filia, you'll find a tall pillar that is supporting a round dish on top. Various explorers that have lost their way in the desert because of the sandstorm have found their direction through this pillar, so people call it [Longa's Lighthouse]. When this lighthouse is half covered in sand, you'll see a round dish mark glowing.

11166	Now lets learn how to use the L-Rod, the most basic tool used to find the site of ruins. Equip your hand with the L-Rod and roam around, and you'll receive a distinctive reaction from it based on the distance from the ruins. You'll be able to tell based on how long the light is on, as well as the sound and the frequency of the beeping noise. If the L-Rod loudly beeps four times, that means you are close to the site of ruins. That's when you press 'X' and click on the ground where you feel the site of ruins is located.

11175	Patrol Rano Base Camp

11188	Time sure flies... I can't believe how old you are already. Ha... Come see me sometime. I'll be waiting. -Weide-
11189	Talk with Weide
11190	Hehe, 40 is an age I envy. <username/>. <br/>It's the best time...<br/>I sometimes dream of going back to that time too. Hahaha. <br/>How embarrassing at your age. <br/>Anyway, you're at an age where you need to be careful about your health. <br/>Use my gift wisely.
11191	Break The Tree
11192	A Physis Giant should be able to easily break a whole tree with two hands and use it as a weapon. It's something Elves could never even attempt. I myself will show you which trees make for good weapons. -Krug-

11199	How is it? Is it difficult to actually try it? Hahaha.<br/>However, it is a Pisis Giant only if you fold a tree with a single blow.<br/>Logs are a very useful weapon in close quarters.<br/>Well, why not try using it for hunting once?<p/>It's regrettable to use it like a young brown piss fox.<br/>Use the logs to hunt about 10 young brown piss foxes.<br/>Attack skills that enhance the power of close combat<br/>It will be a good opportunity to make it F rank.
11200	Try Repair
11201	Taking care of your weapon should be a lifelong habit. Your weapons must be rusty from all the training. Let me look at them. -Taunes-
11202	Speak with Taunes
11203	Ask Taunes to repair weapon
11204	If you continue to use any weapon,<br/>its durability will decrease and it will become unusable.<br/>If that were to happen on the battlefield, it could be fatal. <p/>Check the wear and tear on your weapons on a regular basis,<br/>and repair them as needed. <p/>I'll repair your weapon,<br/>but you can have your clothes repaired at a clothing store. <p/>After the conversation is over, try repairing any of your equipment. <br/>If there's no equipment that needs repairing now<br/>you can do it after you've used it more.
11205	Throwing Attack
11206	You should know from experience that close-combat isn't everything in battles. You need to know how to attack an enemy from a distance to have a balanced attack. We don't use silly toys like the bows that elves use. I'll teach you about how to throw a spear - Krug
11207	Speak with Krug
11208	Practice the throwing attack once on a Young Brown Physis Fox
11209	Report to Krug
11210	If you ’re a great warrior of the Pisis Giant<br/>You must be able to treat his spear like your own limbs.<br/>Let's do this spear.<p/>Hold a spear and a spear-thrower in your hand<br/>Click on the enemy from a distance with the mouse to attack.<br/>You'll soon find that it's a very efficient tactic.
11211	So far, I have taught about close combat and long-range combat, which are the basics of combat.<br/>Other full-scale combat methods<br/>Learn from Tawns, the war god of Pysis.<p/>Oh! Then one more!<br/>I've been watching that battle so far,<br/>Apparently there is not enough stamina.<p/>Because I will introduce a giant that will help solve it<br/>After finishing this quest, wait for a while.
11212	Sketch the Sun Bearing Statue
11213	There are many artifacts in Physis. Research is being done about these artifacts even at this very moment. I was thinking of telling you about sketching, which is a basic part of all explorations. -Krug-
11214	Speak with Krug
11215	Sketch a statue bearing a sun
11216	Deliver Sketch to Krug
11217	We giants explore to uncover the secrets of the ancient giants.<br/>The basis of exploration is sketching.<br/>I'm sure you've already learned this from Meruel,<br/>but I'll teach you again.<p/><image local='true' name='npctalk_sketch' width='620' height='200' />When you come across something you want to draw while walking,<br/>open your inventory and right-click on the drawing paper.<br/>Next, select "Use" and<br/>click on the object you want to draw. <p/><image local='true' name='npctalk_sketch' width='620' height='200' />To cancel while drawing,<br/>press the ESC key or click on the skill icon above your head. <p/>Sketching is also a type of action. <br/>You can also register the action button as a shortcut key on the screen and use it. <p/>You will need the paper with the picture drawn on it when you report.<br/>Make sure to bring it with you.
11218	You've done a good job drawing it.<br/>However, many of the ruins on the continent of Iria are hidden by magic and must be searched for with the L-Rod.<br/>Even if you find one, it may disappear before you can sketch it.<p/>Soon you will be tasked with using the L-Rod to search for hidden ruins.<br/>Pisces right now needs not only strong warriors, but capable explorers as well.
11219	Counterattack Training
11220	I'll teach you a skill that can counter an enemy's attack. -Taunes-
11221	Speak with Taunes
11222	Use the Counterattack skill against a Young Brown Dingo 1 time
11223	Report to Taunes
11224	You seem to be getting used to fighting too.<br/>However, from now on, the opponent's enemies will become stronger.<br/>Before that, I'd like to teach you this skill.<p/>The counter attack skill is a skill that uses the power of the opponent's melee attack to deal damage.<br/>When you use the skill, you will be in a position to stop there and wait for the enemy's attack.<br/>At this time, if the enemy makes a melee attack,<br/>You can use that power to repeat the attack.<p/>However, if you receive a bow or magic attack while waiting for your opponent's melee attack,<br/>He will be damaged as it is.<br/>So it's a good idea to carefully observe the skills your opponent uses.<br/>Would you like to try hunting?
11225	The main weapon of the elf race is the bow.<br/>His counterattack does not work against the elf's bow attack.<br/>It may be more advantageous to use a stomp or spear.<p/>Anyway, use the skills that are suitable for the situation.<br/>What is suitable depends on the skill used by the opponent.<br/>Everything is an experience.<br/>Through that experience, a sense of combat is cultivated.
11226	Scoop water
11227	Ahh, my head~ I just woke up and I have a skull-crushing headache. Did I drink too much yesterday? What's better than an ice cold water for hangovers? Hey~ buddy, I'll show you how to scoop water form the well. -Wanst-

Just thinking about it will make you feel good!<p/>That's not all.<br/>If you have stomp skills, you can break the thick ice of the Reus River and fish.<br/>You can even blow the snow away and discover what's buried in the snow.<p/>This stomp is the ruler of the snowfield, Pysis Giant.<br/>I've mastered how to use my cousin quickly.<p/>
11240	Then give Kirine the wine I've just done.<br/>Keep it a secret that I sent it to the other guys?<br/>Then I asked you, my friend!

You can't call it real sake unless it's about this.<br/>Oh, by the way, you seem to be becoming a warrior little by little ...<br/>I don't know how to grow up from now on.<p/>Will you be a man who burns a woman as hot as this liquor?<br/>Anyway, will I become a man who is like a cheap wine ... Ufufu.<p/>... Oh, Tawns.<br/>From him you can feel the strength of a male like hot lava.<br/>It melts the core of a woman ...<p/>This Kirine-sama is watching to see if you can do that too.<br/>I'll do my best at best. Ufufu.

11297	Practice the Weaving skill
11298	I hear that you are much better at extracting threads and making fabric now. Lately we've had a sudden increase in the number of explorers here, and I have been getting a lot of requests on robes.

11315	Memories of the Smash attack
11316	Seeing you train these days reminds me of the times I used to train vigorously on the Smash attack. I remember being frustrated often because I couldn't master the skill. On that note, why don't you train hard and reach your Smash skill to rank 8? -Taunes-
11317	Obtain Smash Skill Rank 8
11318	Hunt Down the White Dingo

11323	Collect 5 Wool
11324	I heard a lot about you from Alexina. My name is Heulfryn from Qilla Base Camp. I need a lot of Sheep fur to make bandages... Could you get me 5 Sheep fur? I've never asked something like this to a Giant. I can trust you, right? I'll give you all the tools you need. -Heulfryn-

11331	You brought the wool.<br/>If you take 5 wool and use a spinning wheel outside the camp<br/>You can make thick threads.<p/>I will teach you textile skills<br/>If you are interested, why not try using the skill.
11332	Oops, you brought a thick thread properly.<br/>It's bad to have a lot of help.<br/>If you make threads in the future,<br/>Use the spinning wheel at any time.

11375	First Aid and Resurrection
11376	If you get injured during combat, your Max HP that can be healed goes down. Although I can heal those injuries for you, you're in big trouble if you get injured like that far away from Vales such as in a dungeon. In order to be prepared for such situation, I will teach you the First Aid skill where you can heal injuries using bandages. - Kirine

11379	The Crown Jewel of Melee Combat, Windmill
11380	There are few other close-combat skills, but let me teach you about a flashy and powerful skill called the windmill. -Taunes-
11381	Speak with Taunes
11382	Use the Windmill on a Young Brown Physis Fox 5 times
11383	Speak with Taunes
11384	Have you got used to defense and smash?<br/>I'm thinking of teaching windmill skills this time.<p/>The windmill rotates in a low position and<br/>He is a brilliant skill that attacks all enemies in range.<br/>It ’s an aggressive skill, but it also reduces your physical strength.<br/>If you use it carelessly, you may end up in danger.
11385	Windmills are more effective in narrow spaces such as dungeons and underground mazes.<br/>And while using the windmill<br/>Because all attacks received from the enemy are invalidated<br/>Only at that moment is almost invincible.<p/>However, when used, the vitality also decreases,<br/>Also, when the windmill is over<br/>Become defenseless for a while. Always pay attention to these two points.
11386	Learn about Healing
11387	Ha... Krug says you've been learning the basic skills of combat. I was thinking of maybe teaching you how to recover your strength using Mana. -Weide-
11388	Talk with Weide
11389	Restore someone's health with healing
11390	Talk with Weide
11391	@Healing
11392	Using healing on yourself will restore your vitality, but it will<br/>take up a lot of stamina.<br/>That's why you usually use your healing on others and<br/>ask them to heal you. <p/>Using healing consumes a lot of mana. <br/>Next, I'll teach you about this mysterious power called mana and<br/>how to increase your mana. <p/>After completing this quest, you should acquire a skill called Magic Mastery. <br/>It doesn't need to be activated by pressing a shortcut key like other skills. <br/>As you level up the skill, your maximum mana will automatically increase. <p/>If you want to know more about magic,<br/>try learning various offensive spells, such as ice, fire, lightning bolt, etc.
11393	Defense training
11394	It's Taunes. By using the Defense skill before you get hit by an enemy's attack, you can block the attack and minimize its damage. Also you can attack immediately after. I received a request from Queen Kirine to help you.
11395	Speak with Taunes
11396	Hunt 5 Young Brown Dingos
11397	Report to Taunes
11398	I've heard from Queen Kirine.<br/>Are you a giant who needs defensive skills?<p/>I don't want to think about wars and battles for the time being ...<br/>I have no choice but to obey the orders of the Vashbar royal family.<p/>Let's get started.<br/>First, how to prevent enemy attacks<br/>Know that it's more important than how you attack.<p/>No matter how small an animal is attacking<br/>If you keep eating, you will lose your life.<br/>That's why defense skills should always be mastered as the basis of combat.<p/>By defending<br/>You can prevent the enemy's normal melee attack and arrow attack once.<br/>For those who jump in as soon as they see it as an enemy<br/>It is also effective to use the defense skill first.<p/>However, there are also skills that defeat defense skills and strike attacks.<br/>Let's teach it after learning defense.<br/>First, try hunting with your defense skills.
11399	When you are fighting an enemy using defense<br/>Occasionally there is a guy who breaks the defense and hits the attack.<br/>This attack cannot be prevented by using defense.<br/>The name of the technique is ... "Smash".<p/>Because it's a skill that you can use<br/>Use it against enemies who are using defense.<br/>If you are a clever guy, you will notice a smash attack,<br/>Be careful as you can cancel the defense and make a normal attack.<br/>If you gain experience, you should be able to read the behavior of the other person.
11400	Collect Berries
11401	Hey~ It's me, Wanst. Haha. You can't recover the blackened area of your Stanima bar caused by hunger just by drinking a Stamina potion. To ease your hunger, you need to... hmm... what else could you do but to eat something? -Wanst-

11407	Visit Queen Kirine
11408	Did you ever notice that the HP and Stamina you lose during combat doesn't recover as quickly as you would like? Ha, an exhausted Giant is no good. Come see me sometime and I'll tell you how to use potions and recover your Stamina. Don't tell me you're going to refuse to come see the Queen of Physis now. You're not that stubborn, right?

11412	@Potion_Training
11413	Did you learn about potions?<br/>If you drink a lot of potion at once, side effects will occur.<br/>The ability score may drop temporarily.<br/>Instead of relying solely on potions, you should naturally rest and recover your strength.<p/>Try using your break skills.<br/>First, press the [Skill] button at the bottom of the screen. You may press the S key.<br/>Does the skill window open and you can see the break skill with the yellow icon?<p/>You can use it in the skill window you are seeing now,<br/>Put the icon in the shortcut window on the screen<br/>You may use it with the F1 to F12 function keys.<p/>If you rest using your break skills<br/>You can recover the lost vitality a little faster.<br/>Once you practice<br/>You will be able to learn it soon.

Please accept it. <p/>Was mineral collection useful? <br/>Mineral collection has only recently become known on the Iria continent. <br/>Therefore, I don't know the details either, <br/>but I'll tell you some stories I've heard from people. <p/>People who collect minerals like rainy days. <br/>When it rains, the ores that sink to the ground float to the surface of the water, <br/>so it's easier to find ores that you don't normally see. <p/>These rare ores are said to be different colors from ordinary ores, but I've never actually seen them so I don't really know. <p/>And if you're lucky, there are also gems mixed in with the ore fragments. <br/>That's all I know,<br/>but if you ask the people at the camp about gems,<br/>I'm sure they'll be able to give you more information.

12384	Speak with Voight
12385	It was just a while ago. A stranger--wrapped in a thick, long robe--came to Cor. Imagine wearing a thick robe in this hot weather. At that time, we were even having the tropical nights phenomenon.  That's how I knew he was weird.<p/>As far as bizarreness goes, his artifact was worse. It was severely damaged, and I was barely able to restore it. The restored artifact looked particularly strange. <p/>It seemed to be a fragment of a relic, and every time I would apply a different chemical to it, new information would be discovered as if I were peeling the layers of an onion.<p/>Then I thought it might be the ’Heart of Courcle’, something that's recently been getting a lot of attention.<p/>I don’t know anything about that man: his name, where he lives, or why he wanted to restore the artifact.<p/>I didn’t even see his face because it was shrouded by the hood of his robe.<p/>Still, no one can hide from my sharp eyes, you know? Judging by the way he walked and moved, I think he’s an Elf. It’s fishy, you know? Out of curiosity, I borrowed Waboka's horse, though I didn't let him know about it, to go to Filia beyond the Longa Desert. Guess what I found after riding the horse in the sandy wind of the desert? "... ...Well, I’m sorry, but I’ve never heard of it before..." That’s what all the Elves told me. Every single one of them said exactly the same thing.<p/>Umm... Argh, this is getting more suspicious. I don’t believe them at all when they say that they’ve never heard of the Heart of Courcle. I mean, think about it.<p/>Every single adventurer in Iria is desperately looking for that heart, yelling the “Heart of Courcle” everywhere they go.<p/>I don’t know, but something strange is happening in Iria.

12440	You seem to be pretty interested in music! Gather in from of the bonfire, and sit down, and listen to someone playing music while drinking  cut of sake...! Well, anyways, continue to practice. If you reach [Rank D Playing Instrument], then I will give you a book that might be useful for music - Wanst
12441	It sounds like you're doing your best to learn how to play an instrument. I also have to keep my promises. Here is the book I promised you. <p/>The book was written by humans, so it's hard to get here. Although it is regrettable as a giant, humans are more likely to be good at music. That book should be useful.
12442	My name is 'Loeiz', the author of 'Erinn Music's History' volumes 1 and 2. I'm surprised to find out that my book is being read far across the ocean, even in the Giant village. It would be extremely gratifying for me if you read my book and continued to developing your music skills. If you ever get your Musical Knowledge skill to rank A, I'll give you another book of mine as well. -Loeiz-
12443	I've heard about your diligent studies in music composition. You must really love music, huh? Hahaha. I myself once took an interest in music, and even composed my own songs. Keep up the good work in practicing compositional skills. If you attain Composition at Rank E, I'll give you some of my blank music books. -Wanst-
12444	Report to Wanst
12445	It's good to write your own songs. I used to compose when I was young... but as I got older, my songs got better. <p/>I'll give you a blank score, so try hard and keep composing. And then write a song that is suitable for drinking wine to. I will be very willing to listen, of course, with my wine.

12624	... You already knew everything. I won’t deny any of it... But that doesn’t mean my convictions have changed. <p/>... How to restore Kelpie’s memory... There’s no way to tell as of now. The only thing I can tell you... is that the Memory Tower used to manipulate the memory was made in the image of the relic left by Irinid.<p/>Perhaps the answer lies in Zardine, where all of this started.
12625	Well, if you want to learn more about Zardine, then you must first learn about the Gold Dragon. Although, you should keep in mind that legends are legends after all. We may never know just how much truth there is to such stories.<p/>In any case, it is said that the Gold Dragon is born and destroyed every few thousand years. <p/>Some people interpret the legend in symbolic terms, rather than as a physical phenomenon that actually occurs. <p/>But anyway, during its birth, the dragon apparently goes through a process known as the ‘Conduction Ceremony'... <p/>You might call it a moment in which the Dragon becomes one with an existential being of Erinn. <p/>The character of the chosen being, knows as the Conductor, supposedly determines whether the Gold Dragon is to turn evil or grow into a dragon that fights for the good of Erinn. <p/>The birth of a new Gold Dragon and a Conduction Ceremony is scheduled to come to pass. <p/>As the day approaches, the activity of the two rival forces, the Blue Dragon and Red Dragon, have been unusual... <p/>We can’t predict exactly when the scheduled Conduction Ceremony will occur but there have already been strange signs that have been confirmed. Would you like to help me with a few missions? <p/>First, there seems to be a huge disparity of temperature inside the Flints as we approach the Conduction Ceremony. <p/>Could you get me 10 Flints, so that I may analyze them?
12626	Hmm... Judging by the crystal inside the Flints, they seem to be different from their usual state.<br/>But this isn’t enough evidence. <p/>I heard that the animals near the volcanic region have become extremely unsettled recently. Could you help me study these animals? <p/>If you could tame some wild animals, that might just be what we need.	
12627	It has been confirmed that the entire ecosystem of Zardine has been affected by the Conduction Ceremony. <p/>We’re currently drawing up plans to investigate certain regions we think<br/>may be the location in which the Conduction Ceremony might occur. <p/>Unfortunately, those Wyverns have become so aggressive as of late, that it’s become difficult to even launch a Hot-Air Balloon from anywhere in Zardine. <p/>You’re the expert when it comes to such things aren’t you? Could you lend me a hand?

12656	You don’t have to explain what happened at Lava Fall. I already know. <p/>It’s not your fault that you fell into the trap of the wicked Red Dragon, Crumena. Don’t be so hard on yourself. <p/>I don’t know how someone from this world was able to get involved so heavily regarding the fate of the dragon race, but I get the feeling that this, too, must have been fate. <p/>Originally, Iria was ruled by dragons. The arrogance of the dragons brought Irinid to this land and after losing the Irinid war, the dragons were exiled to the barren land of Zardine. Within the barrier drawn by Irinid,<br/>our race decided to endure and accept what can be seen as our punishment. <p/>However, there are those who viewed this way of life for the dragons as feeble and disgraceful. These were the Red Dragons, the ones, who after being defeated at the Irinid War, lost their power and had to walk the path of shame. <p/>Although what they envisioned was a revolution and not peace, it could not be done within the dragon society of Zardine where the Blue Dragons were already in control. But now an opportunity has been given to them. The Gold Dragon, Adniel’s Conduction Ceremony is nearing, and the Red Dragons are planning to use this event for political gain. <p/>Their first move will probably be	<br/>trying to set up a trap for Cromm Cruaich You should know that you, too, were probably used for their scheme. Cromm Cruaich is not only the leader of the Blue Dragons but also the dragon that represents Zardine.<p/>At the time, it was leading the dragon’s contractor, a red-haired Human, to Iria to prepare for the Conduction Ceremony of the Gold Dragon. <p/>Although Cromm Cruaich fell into Lava Fall, the hottest part of Zardine, it’s too early to give up hope yet. Right before Cromm Cruaich died, it was able to protect the dragon’s contractor by using its final protection magic. <p/>I can still feel the red-haired Human breathing.<p/>If you could get your hands on the Physis Snow Crystal, which can break through the scorching heat of Lava Fall, you might still be able to turn back the costly error that you unknowingly made.

12662	It has been confirmed that the spirit of the ancient Giants has been discovered at the Irai Ruins. With this new discovery, the ownership of the Ruins should rightfully belong to the Giants. <p/>Of course, I expect there to be some confrontation with the Elves during this process. If there is confrontation, we will have no choice but to respond to it. I am thinking of forming an expedition for this very purpose. <p/>If Taunes, the greatest warrior of Vales, leads the way the Elves won't stand a chance... I heard that you and Taunes are quite close. Would you go to Taunes and convince him to take on this mission?
12663	Is he planning to start another meaningless war? I will not partake in this. Either way, my eyesight is getting worse by the day so there's not much I can do...
12664	He's going to reject the King's command!? How could he...? I guess what Kirine said about Taunes was right all along. <p/>This time I can't forgive him. He will pay thoroughly for this!

12691	It's me, Duncan. I wish to tell you a little bit about a traditional game we play here in Erinn. -Duncan-
12692	Talk with Duncan
12693	There's a great traditional game that we play here in Erinn. It's a seesaw game called Jump for the Moon. First, you create a big seesaw using a Seesaw Construction Kit. Next, two people stand atop either end of the seesaw. Then, they jump! <p/>The moment those two people breathe and jump in harmony, they will experience a feeling like no other, like flying through the air! I'll give you a Seesaw Construction Kit to get you started. Give it a try. <p/>You can purchase more kits from the General Shop. Now, go ahead. Try jumping for the moon! If you can jump high enough, perhaps something extraordinary will happen...?

13252	Is it Fallon?<br/>Speaking of Fallon ... I only know information about the captain of the Guard of the Kingdom of Eirif.<br/>I have rarely met in person.<br/>Most of the expeditionary work is done through Deputy Andras ...<br/>It may sound like a prejudice against other races,<br/>I don't know much about a person named Fallon.
13253	Fallon's subpoena?<p/>If you got Fallon's subpoena<username/> and<br/>Do you mean to join the expedition?<br/>It's just right. See you on the battlefield.
13254	Are you Captain Fallon?<br/>Speaking of Captain Fallon, of course, Tarteen<br/>I don't think anyone in Erinn knows about it, right?<p/>You see, there's a statue of Lou Lavada near the square, right?<br/>During the Moitura War with that Light Knight Lou<br/>He is a hero who protected Erinn from the demons.<p/>Fufu ... I was called directly by such a person<br/>I'm a little too<username/>I wonder if you are interested in Mr.

13256	As an alchemist under the auspices of His Majesty Effleurage McCul II of the Erifu royal government<br/>It is obligatory to support the Royal Guard.<p/>However, since the recent discovery of the shadow world,<br/>Explicit troops such as the Royal Guard, elves, and giant expeditions<br/>The situation of being stationed in Tarteen is not desirable.<p/>I admit the fact that Talteen in the past was a military hub to protect the capital, Tara.<br/>I think today's Tarteen is right when it comes to the city of alchemy.<p/>… By the way, I think Fallon isn't in Tarteen right now.<br/>I heard that he recently led an expedition and is performing a mission in the shadow world.<br/>Oh ... what should I do? I would make another mistake ...<br/>Andras told me not to talk about military security and he told me not to talk about it ...<br/>If you meet Andras, don't tell the story I just told you.

14332	Have you been asked by Tawns?<br/>He sometimes has a very reckless place ...<username/>It would be really dangerous for you to come to such a place ...<p/>… But that's why I might think of him specially …….<br/>Can you tell Tawns that you're fine?<p/>Recently, I've been busy with a lot of tourists coming and going.<br/>It doesn't hurt your body ...
14333	Is Atlata fine without incident?<br/>Fortunately. Thank you for the good news,<username/>..<br/>So let's finish the talk with you first.<p/>This proved that you have devoted yourself.<br/>Qualification is enough to learn the skill "Taunt" to protect allies.<p/>Taunt Skill tries to attack your allies<br/>It's a skill that draws the enemy's attention to you.<br/>It's one of the skills you should learn if you think of your peers.<p/>If you have enough protection, the effect will be multiplied.

14353	It can be said that the essence of the arrow lies in the arrow.<br/>It is no exaggeration to say that the nature of the arrow is determined by this part.<br/>Of course there is a way to adjust the length of the arrow, but<br/>It's a very dangerous act to sacrifice balance.<p/>Recently I'm doing research on yajiri.<br/>If you don't mind, would you please bring me various swords?
14354	Which ... I see ... This amber-like shade of light,<br/>The delicate light that passes through is like a faint sunset ...<br/>Okay, then bring the emerald arrow.
14355	Hard work ... which ... it's an emerald beautiful glow,<br/>Do you know it? Emeralds are said to symbolize hope and stability.<br/>Alright, bring the amethyst arrow at the end.<br/>That completes all the preparations.

There is a reason for everything.<br/>Besides buying it at the market. Because the owl is watching properly.
14825	Most young people get angry and give up here, but something is different about you.<br/>It doesn't seem to make any sense, but it was all a training process.<br/>Did you feel your strength increase while chopping firewood and collecting corn?<p/>Is it a line you've heard somewhere? It's because of my mind.<br/>Kohon, it's your real mission from now on.<br/>To use the new magic, the wand must first get used to it.<br/>Yeah ... you have to feel like your own hands.<p/>I'll do one wand, so use it until it breaks and you can't use it.

14833	Find the Hidden Eye of the Sun with an L-Rod
14834	Talk with Hagel
14835	Many ruins are hidden in the vast desert of Konnuth.<br/>These ruins are said to be legacies left behind by the ancient elves...<p/>Unfortunately, there are no elves left who know<br/>what these ruins were made for...<p/>Many elves are involved in excavating the ruins in search of their lost memories.<p/>To find the ruins hidden by magic,<br/>you will need an L-Rod, so I will give you one.<p/><image name='npctalk_l_rod' width='200' height='200' />When you move around with the L-Rod in both hands,<br/>light and sound will be emitted in response to the magical power hiding the ruins.<p/><image name='npctalk_l_rod' width='200' height='200' />When you hear the sound of four beeps,<br/>don't forget that there is a ruin nearby! <p/><image local='true' name='npctalk_searching_ruins' width='625' height='200' />So, by pressing the shortcut key <hotkey name='UseLRod'/> and clicking the ground,<br/>you can cancel the magic and find the hidden ruins. <p/><show_dir pos='334470 417190' pitch='15'/><image name='NPC_suntower' width='200' height='200' />Shall we search for the magically hidden Eye of the Sun? <br/>It has been reported that the magically hidden Eye of the Sun has been found<br/>on the left path leading from the village to Erance Valley.
14836	You're also good at using the L-Rod. <br/>I believe that your skills, <br/><username/>, will be a great help as you excavate various ruins in the future. <p/>Castanea says that forgotten ancient ruins<br/>should be left alone...<br/>but I believe it is our duty to revive their memories. <p/>Oh, and when you have to sketch the ruins you've discovered with the L-Rod<br/>sometimes the ruins disappear before you've finished sketching them. <br/>When that happens, don't panic, just use the L-Rod to find new ruins. <p/>So, have a pleasant journey.
14837	Counterattack Training
14838	Are you interested in learning a melee combat skill that will come in very handy when battling one on one? It's called Counterattack, and it will allow you to counter your enemy's attack. - Meles
14839	Speak with Meles
14840	Try using Counterattack 3 times against a young brown-tailed mongoose
14841	Report to Meles
14842	Fufu. A little like an elf warrior<br/>It looks like you're getting a look.<br/>Then, this time, I will counterattack by using the enemy's melee attack in reverse.<br/>I'll teach you about counter attack skills!<p/>As I said, the counter attack is<br/>A skill that uses the attack power of the enemy.<br/>That's why you can't use it unless the enemy makes a melee attack.<p/>If the enemy attacks with a bow or magic<br/>Because it's a completely meaningless skill<br/>Just be careful there.<p/><show_dir pos='405905 429298' pitch='15'/>If the enemy attacks with a bow or magic<br/>Because it's a completely meaningless skill<br/>Just be careful there.<p/>For the time being, if you try it about 3 times,<username/>Then I think you can get the hang of it.<br/>Then, please do your best!
14843	Thank you for your hard work!<br/>copper? Timing to use counter attack,<br/>Was it difficult?<p/>When the mongooses are attacked<br/>I'll run right away and fight back<br/>It's a good partner to practice.<p/>Well ... I think I found out after trying it,<br/>If your opponent mainly uses ranged attacks or magic,<br/>Counter attacks aren't very useful.<br/>You know this, right?<p/>In other words, during battle, according to the opponent's attack pattern,<br/>Which of the skills you have ...<br/>Don't forget that such tactics will also be needed.

14852	that? I asked Castanea for this ...?<br/>You brought it instead.<br/>Thank you,<username/>！<p/>Yeah ... Castanea-sama from me in close quarters<br/>You told me to learn about skills.<br/>Hmm ... I wonder what to talk about ...<p/>From Castanea, about the battle with a bow<br/>Did you learn a lot?<p/>Then you know, after attacking with a bow<br/>Before preparing the next arrow<br/>You've been hit back a lot, right?<p/>In such a case, while running away<br/>Aim for a chance to attack again ── It's okay, but<br/>If possible, press the Tab key to switch to a weapon other than a bow,<br/>I think you should fight with your bare hands and weapons.<p/>Then, immediately<br/>Fight the enemy with your bare hands or weapons,<br/>Try raising your attack skill to F rank.<p/>a. I think you know,<br/>Even if you hit a tree, a sign, or something that doesn't move<br/>It's not a practice, right?<p/><show_dir pos='371660 402404' pitch='15'/>Yeah ... I went down all the way down the village<br/>At the foot of the hill, without a bow<br/>Defeat about 5 young black armadillos.<p/>Fight for a while<br/>When the attack becomes F rank,<br/>Please come back to me.
14853	Welcome back. how was it?<br/>Isn't it a little difficult to try in close quarters?<br/>Unlike a bow, you attack once ...<br/>Repeating that all the time is the biggest feature of close combat.<p/>However, if you are attacked by the other party as it is, you will not have it, right?<br/>Therefore, what is needed is the basic and defense skills of close combat!<br/>If you use your defense skills before being attacked by your opponent,<br/>You can fight back immediately while minimizing the damage.<p/>Because it is a skill that is often used even when using a bow as the main<br/>I recommend registering it as a shortcut key on the screen and using it.<p/>Oh, you don't have to worry about your skills.<br/>I'll tell you.<br/>good? Once you learn how to do it<br/>You only have to practice until you get it firmly !!<p/>Then, if you complete this quest<br/>I'll give you a book about defense.<br/>Please use it as a reference when you have any questions.

After placing a clean mana herb under the meat and then grilling it with garlic, it seems to prevent the fragrances of the mana herb from seeping in, but it makes the juices from the meat flow out. Also.... Hmm...? Oh yes, if you share it with other people, the effects are heightened. ...Anyway, how about you try making it once? - Glenis -

16612	Seems like because you are interested, that you came.<br/>I recently researched how to implement the principles of ice mines<br/>to other things.<p/>However, it has not achieved the desired effect.<br/>Can you help me find unknown ore fragments?<br/>I used ice mines with the research, using the unknown ore fragments to craft the ice mines.<p/>We should be able to see the results of my research soon.
16613	You really helped me by finding it!<br/>Was it difficult to find? Thank you so much!<p/>Can you wait for me here?<br/>I want to study it a bit.<p/>...<p/>...<p/>...<p/>Come here and look!<br/>Using this method<br/>we can use the strength of magic with our arrow heads.<p/>How should we name this principle?<p/>We only have a short time to use it,<br/>Besides, the magic can only be transferred from the stove, which makes it unusable...<p/>I have the formula here. Please take it to Tir Chonaill's Lassar.<br/>It could possibly work with the power of magic.
16614	You said that Dorren had you bring this over?<br/>Show me the formula.<p/>Oh, this alchemic method<br/>might have unwanted effects.<br/>So long as it does not require the stove, but using something else, it works?<p/>If that's how it is, we can achieve results quickly.<p/>Although, recently at Ciar Dungeon<br/>there seems to be Laghodessas.<p/>Others have also reported seeing them outside the dungeon.<br/>I'm not sure if that is true, but there seems to be a larger population.<br/>I'm going to stay here and continue reseaching the formula！ Go check out the dungeon in my stead.
16615	Did you really kill the Laghodessa that quickly?<br/>Wow...You really are exceptional.<p/>Though, I'm not that inferior to you, as I have studied the formula well.<br/>Ok...<p/>The fourth line of this method<br/>is used with the bow.<p/>When the arrow strikes its target<br/>it will also identify surrounding targets.<br/>Then, the arrow will strike the target and explode<br/>and the explosion will create debris striking the surrounding enemies.<p/>Remember<br/>it should be used where there are many enemies gathered.
