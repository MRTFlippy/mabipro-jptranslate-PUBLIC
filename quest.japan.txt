1559	<title name="NONE" />（I hand Elen 2 Gold Ores）<p/>So, did you think that was pretty tough?<p/>Recently because of the monsters, no one has been going in the dungeon.<br/>There is a person who Comgan asks to go mining, but...<br/>I am a little worried if the situation continues...<p/>It would be safer if someone would regularly go mining.<br/>Ah! I talk too much!<p/>
1560	Defeat Giant White Wolf
1561	It is Deian from Tir Chonaill. There is a giant white wolf that sometimes appears in Tir Chonaill's pasture. It is attacking the sheep and I cannot protect them. Could you please come and defeat the giant white wolf?
1562	Speak with Deian
1563	Eliminate the Giant White Wolf
1564	Speak with Deian
1565	Hey, <username/>!  I was waiting for you!<p/>Have you heard of the gigantic white wolf appearing in Tir Chonaill?<br/>Occasionally, it appears where the other wolves are, and then attacks the sheep.<p/>When they appear, they cause so much damage.<p/>Please eliminate the giant white wolf for me.<br/>I will give you a reward if you get rid of it for me.<p/>When you want to know the place and time where they appear,<br/>just ask about "Nearby Rumors" from the local villagers in Tir Chonaill.<br/>I can tell you occasionally.<p/>Well then, good luck!<p/>
1566	
1567	You really helped me out.<p/>I was so worried about the sheep.<br/>Thank you!<p/>

1574	Secret of the Snowman
1575	You will find the road to Sidhe Sneachta on the way to Alby Dungeon, north of town. An earring was lost while making a snowman. Can you look for it? - Duncan -
1576	Deliver the lost earring to Duncan.
1577	Well done.<p/>It must have been difficult finding the earring on the snowy slopes of Sidhe Sneachta,<br/>but somehow you found it.<p/>Hmm...actually, this favor was for someone else.<br/>He said he thought he accidently misplaced the arring in a snowman he was building<br/>and he asked me to help him find it.<p/><image name='G1_Ch01_sidhesnechta'/>If you head toward Sidhe Sneachta, I heard there is a strange structure there.<br/>He said he made the snowman in remembrance of seeing that building...<p/>They say the structure is <br/>connected to another place by some magical power...<br/>But it doesn't seem like just anyone can enter...<p/>There are alot of rumors surrounding this place,<br/>There's a story about a Druid who lost his family<br/>and couldn't overcome the sorrow...and he turned into a bear.<p/><image name='G1_Ch01_manaherb'/>...They say the bear is gathering Mana Herbs. <br/>If you happen to meet the bear I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea to give it some Mana Herbs as a gift.<p/>Mana Herbs are normally found inside dungeons, <br/>but if you're not confident enough to go explore dungeons, you can always buy some from people. <br/>Nature is so mysterious...how does an herb that produces artificial Mana grow in a place without any moonlight...?<br/>Nature is truly magical...<p/>Well, in order to go north you must reach level 10 or higher first.<br/>I happen to have some Mana Herb. Take this with you.<p/>

Of course.<br/>I'm not surprised...<br/>He doesn't let anyone into his life...<p/>He said he couldn't accept me<br/>because he was living the life of a Druid<p/>...<p/>...Am I nothing more than a tool who understands the Fomor language to him...?<p/>...I'm sorry, but you will need to go back to where he is...<p/>I would like to give the book to him myself.<br/>Please understand why I can't give this book to you.
1592	<title name='NONE'/>（Tarlach listens intently as you relay Kristell's message to him.）<p/>...<br/>Is that what she said...?<br/>But, I cannot leave here.<p/>I understand how she feels, since<br/>she gave up her life as a Fomor...for love...<br/>but I'm not a man who deserves that kind of love...<p/>...Although it was too late when I realized it... and ending up breaking her heart...<p/>...<p/>Could I ask you a favor...?<br/>...I left something with Meven of Tir Chonaill a long time ago.<br/>Would you please retrieve it for me...?<p/>Just go and tell him what I told you<br/>and he will know what you're talking about.
1593	Oh, it's you, <username/> Hello.<p/><title name='NONE'/>（You tell Meven abot Tarlach's item.）<p/>Even if it was Druid magic,<br/>it didn't last this long.<br/>So I was taking care of it through Lassar.<p/>Anyway,<br/>Tarlach still must have not forgotten about her<br/>if he's asking for that item back...<br/>Well, it's really just too sad...<p/>It doesn't mean I will give up.<br/>I will tell Lassar about this matter,<br/>Could you tell me once more about the book...?<br/>Lassar is one of the top experts.<p/>After the current request, meet with Kristell,<br/>She can clear up the contents of the book you received.<br/>...Lassar asked you directly.<br/>Please tell me.<p/>...to get it back...<br/>She seems to be unable to forget Tarlach...<br/>It doesn't matter.

1599	Meet with Aeira
1600	Thank you for sharing the story of my mentor with me, <username/>...<p/>...<p/>Um.. are you telling me that Chief Duncan of Tir Chonaill<br/>wants to... borow the master's book...?<p/>...<p/>... I guess it should be okay.<p/>He is a wise old man who has been through a lot, and<br/>he may be able to catch some things that we may have missed...<p/>Please give this copy to the Chief for me... <p/>
1601	So this is the Book of Revenge that Mores wrote...<br/>Let me take a look at it.<p/>（Duncan skims through the book.）<p/>Hmm...interesting.<br/>I see. Hmm.<br/>Mmm...<p/>...? Is this the end...?<br/>That can't be...<p/>…。<p/><username/>, it doesnt' seem like the book ends here.<br/>Judging by the book's writing style and structure, it seems like ther should be more to it.<br/>Looking at the introduction of the book, it seems like a 3 part series...<p/>It's hard to comment on the Goddess's intentions<br/>just from this part of the book.<br/>Could you find out if there is another book...?<p/>If we can get a hold of the other volumes,<br/>we will be able to figure out how to best respond to Mores and the Goddess,<br/>and waht exactly to say to the King of Aliech.<p/>I am sure you are aware of this, as well...<br/>that it's difficult to get the attention of the King and the lords<br/>with something as vague as this...<p/>I don't know where you found the translation of this book...<br/>but please inquire about the existence of the next volume. Thank you. <p/>
1602	Is there another volume to this book...?<br/>I'm not sure.<br/>Based on the introduction, it seems likely...<p/>I've learned that this book is very popular amongst high-ranking Fomors.<br/>I only found that out while I was translating the book.<p/>Sorry I'm not much help.<br/>Maybe Aeira knows something about this.<br/>When it comes to books, no one's more knowledgeable than her.<p/>
1603	Hello, are you looking for a book?<br/>'The Book of Revenge'...?<br/>I don't think we have a book by that title.<br/>Trust me, I know all the books we carry here...<p/>It's a 3-volume set? If you've already gotten the first<br/>volume, then I can't sell it to you as a set, either...<br/>I doubt they'll let me order each volume seperately.<p/>It's written in the Fomor language?!<br/>I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere for that.<br/>It's going to be hard for a human bookseller to get such<br/>a book, don't you think?<p/><username/>was it?<br/>You have quite a unique taste in books...<p/>You've piqued my interest, and I know<br/>a number of explorers and scholars. I'll ask around.<br/>If I hear anything, I'll get in touch with you. <p/>

1605	I found out how to get the Book of Revenge Volume II. Please come by the Dunbarton Bookstore. - Aeira -

1607	Ah! <username/>Welcome!<p/>Do you remember the book I gave you before, 'Land of Eternity, Tir Na Nog"?<br/>The auth of that book, Leslie, called.<br/>You see, Leslie is a famouse historian and an avid explorer.<p/><image name='G1_Ch21_memo'/>She sent me this note.<br/>It says that she once saw 'The Book of Revenge' inside Ciar dungeon, written in Fomor language. <br/>She said if you offer this note on the altar of Ciar Dungeon, you'll be transported to where you can find the book.<br/>...Apparently this note has some kind of magic on it or something...<p/>And...here, this is Aeira's special gift to you, the Red Wing of the Goddess! <br/>I will give you the note and the Red Wing of the Goddess!<br/>I wish you the best of luck!<p/>Oh, and if you happen to lose the note,<br/>Come see me again. <p/>

1613	Ask Aeira Where the Third Volume Is
1614	You must be here for your translated copy of the book.<br/>Here, I think you should read it yourself.<p/>That said, I can't believe what's written in this book...<p/>
1615	Good job.<br/>You not only found the book but even got it translated...<br/>Here, let me see it.<p/> <title name="NONE"/>（Duncan starts reading the book.）<p/>Hmm... Hah...<p/>So, it's true.<br/>So that's why the Fomor Scroll was made.<p/>The Fomors... recognized that humas and nature<br/>were becoming seperated...<p/>At this point, I think you'll have to find the last volume of the book.<br/>If what I think is true, all of their plans will be in that book. <br/>Ever since the Mag Tuireadh war, <br/>Fomors have been preparing for another war.<p/>We don't know anything for sure yet, but <br/>if we don't find their plan and prevent it, <br/>Erinn might be destroyed...<p/>We have to find the 3rd volume. <br/>Please... You have to find the last book of the Fomors.<p/>...<p/>And don't forget that<br/>you must not tell anyone<br/>about these things regarding the Goddess.<p/>
1616	Since you're looking for volume 3, I'm guess you already<br/>found volume 2? I'm afraid I haven't heard anything about <br/>volume 3 just yet.<p/>It's turning out to be a lot harder to find the last volume.<br/>My distributor has been absolutely useless, and Eavan says <br/>she hasn't come across such a book. Even Leslie says she <br/>doesn't know anything. Same with Stewart.<p/>I've asked everywhere, but I don't know how long it will take.<br/>I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. But even if <br/>you're patient, I just don't have any confidence that I'll<br/>be able to find it...<p/>
1617	Find Book of Revenge Volume III
1618	I heard about the Book of Revenge, Vol. III. Come to the Dunbarton Bookstore immediately. - Aeira -

1620	Ask Lassar in Tir Chonaill for the book.
1621	Meet Seumas at the Dragon Ruins to ask him about the book.
1622	Ah! I've been waiting!<br/>I have good news.<p/>I found out where you can find volume III<br/>of that Fomor book you've been looking for.<br/>Lassar, the magic instructor at the school in<br/>Tir Chonaill has it. You know her, don't you?<p/>She came by looking for a particular book recently,<br/>and while we were chatting, I snuck in a question<br/>about your own search. She says she has the third<br/>volume of "The Book of Revenge"! An original copy<br/>in the Fomor language, no less!<p/>You should hurry up and see her. Good luck!<p/>
1623	Welcome. You must be...<username/>?<p/>...So it was you who was looking for the book.<br/>Aeira had asked me about the book before.<br/>Did she tell you what I told her...?<image name='G1_Ch23_seumas'/>Yes, the book isn't actually mine.<br/>It belongs to Seumas, who works at the ruins excavation site in Gairech.<p/><image name='G1_Ch23_seumas'/>He said he found it not too long ago while excavating the site.<br/>But he could not read the writing<br/>and asked around and came to me to interpret it.<p/>But... it was too difficult for me as well.<br/>Forget translating... I couldn't even read one sentence of it.<br/>I was barely able to figure out the title.<p/>When I told Seumas, he said it was okay, and asked me to return his book, so <br/>as a matter of fact, I just gave the book back to him.<p/>I don't know if you'll be able to read it because it's such a difficult book to read...<br/>but if you want to take a look at it, stop by the...<br/>ruins excavation site in Gairech.<p/>I'm sure Seumas will be happy to find out <br/>if there is indeed a way the book can be translated.<p/>
1624	(He gasps for breath as he speaks.)<br/>Ah... I suppose you're the one Lassar mentioned...?<br/>You need the...book of Fomors...?<p/>Not too long ago...I asked Lassar...<br/>to translate it...but she said she couldn't do it...<p/>I probably won't be able to figure it out myself anyway...<p/>Here...is the...book...<br/>Hope it would be helpful...<p/>

Nobody but your party can help you<br/>in here.<br/>Even if your life ends and you pass away...<p/>When you can't move<br/>You return to your world.<br/>I do think you have to endure that fact, only because you are a human of another world...<p/>...I've called you because a good plan has come up.<p/>Do you.. know about the added soul phenomenon?<br/>It is the phenomenon where the spirit doesn't go away from one's body...<br/>I thought maybe if you were to use this trick<br/>you could let your spirit stay near here.<p/>Yes... if your spirit does not go away from your fallen body and stays near it<br/>there wouldn't be such a thing as having to resurrect back from the world you were in<br/>even if you were to lose the freedom of your body.<p/>But... dealing with spirits is also a dangerous thing...<br/>With the slightest provocation you can turn into one of those zombies behind the graveyard...<p/>...So, I'll have to see if my thoughts are correct.<br/>If you knock down the spiritless zombies<br/>I will measure the added soul phenomenon that happens around the zombies<br/>and see if you can resurrect in this place.<p/>What do you think? Would you like to give it a try?<p/>
1640	
1641	It's just as I'd thought. We can use the added soul phenomenon<br/>and have your spirit stay here.<br/>If you believe me, from now on,<br/>you won't ever be an undead even if you collapse here.<p/>...Yes. My body and soul<br/>are exchanging with you the amount of strength<br/>you need to resurrect here...<p/>Oh no... Are you uncomfortable about exchanging such things with me?<br/>Ha ha, no need to act calm.<br/>But...<p/>Even when you can't move<br/>you can come near me.<br/>You will make it through this world with more ease if you remember this.<p/>

1873	I heard that someone considers me their idea suddenly,<br/>That's right... I wonder if that person is you...<p/>...<p/>Well, that was a joke.<br/>There is a woman at Ceo Island who was really beautiful.<br/>I have never seen such a beautiful woman before.<p/>Her name is Aer.<p/>She is not a human.<br/>Aer is my ideal type.<p/>...<p/>Why did you ask me about this?

1882	Deliver the book to Redire
1883	Well you made it,<username/>.<br/>I need your help.<br/>First of all, look at this.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire hands you an item)<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>This is an item from a helper within the church.<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Esras is secretly communicating with someone<br/>It may look like a regular book, but it's actually a Letter Box.<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Unfortunately, I can't make out exactly what is being said.<br/>They really didn't make any sense...<br/>and some didn't even have the recipient's name on them...<br/>Based on the letter's envelopes along with the recods that were kept for every letter that was sent...<br/>It looks as though the letters were mainly exchanges between someone named Colbha and herself...<p/>Even after an extensive search, however, we couldnt' find anyone in Emain Macha with that particular name.<p/>It seemed a bit suspicious, so I'm just holding on to the letters for now.<br/>After looking closely, though... we realized... that it may have been overwritten in magic,<p/>Unfortunately, I canot solve the magic.<br/>However, if you are familiar with magic, you might be able to solve it.<p/><image name='g2_Ch29_lassar'/>It is too dangerous to ask the people of Emain Macha...<p/>So, I'd like to ask someone who lives in another area,<br/>Apparently there is a woman named Lassar from Tir Chonaill<br/>She is very familiar with magic.<br/>I would like to see if she could solve the magic on this letter.<p/>I cannot take it to her.<br/>Could I depend on you to take this to her<br/>to help me solve the magic?<p/>I can only depend on you...
1884	Oh, do you have something to ask me?<p/><title name='NONE'/>(I showed Lassar the letter from Redire.)<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Well, certainly there is something magical about this.<br/>It's a spell that hides the letter from the paper and replaces it with other, random letters...<p/>Would you like me to solve the magic on this letter?<p/>...<p/>Well...<p/>...<p/>...<p/>Since you're the one asking,<br/><username/>I'll do it for you.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(Lassar draws a figure on top of the letter box and begins reciting a magic spell.)<p/>...<p/>...<p/>...........<p/>.....<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook02'/>......<br/>Okay, this should do. You'll now be able to read the letter.<p/>By the way...<br/>Who's letter box is this?<br/>Is this someone else's collection of love letters?<p/>Well good luck!
1885	Hmmm? You already took care of my request...?<br/><username/>, that's incredible...<p/><image name='G2_Ch29_letterbook01'/>Show me the letter at once.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(I pass the letter to Redire, and he reads it carefully.)<p/>...<p/>...So... this is how it was... AAAhhhhhh!!!<p/>I can't believe this!<br/>I can't believe I fell for their antics!<p/>...<p/>Hey, by the way... This... Something's not right.<br/>This letter box contains both the letters received AND letters sent...<p/>It's supposed to be that Esras only has the letters from Colbha, not the letters that she wrote to Colbha...?<br/>And also, after the tragedy of Emain Macha took place, the letters stop.<p/>This is just my feeling, but Colbha is probably not alive.<br/>Anyway, I'm beginning to wonder why she'd put all these in the letter box...<p/>If I were her, I'd have just thrown them away... I just can't figure it out.<br/>Surely there is something...<p/><username/>.<br/>You should ponder this information, <br/>but please don't do anything until there is definitive evidence against Esras.<p/>An owl will send you an item after a little while.<br/> Be safe until then.
1886	A Small Locked Box
1887	This small box was discovered in Esras room. However, it is locked and I cannot open it. If I try to forcefully open it the contents inside will break. I need someone to take it to Riocard in Bangor, I heard that he specializes in unlocking things like this. - Redire -

I wonder...<br/>Well, as I promised, here is the booklet from inside.<p/><title name='NONE'/>(I received a booklet from Riocard.)
1891	Oh, <username/>!<br/>I was worried, because I hadn't heard from you.<p/><image name='G2_Ch30_booklet'/>Hmm, it seems that you managed to get it opened.<br/>Well then, show me what's inside.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire reads the booklet carefully.)<p/>That should be...<br/>Laoch and I have been in contact.<br/>Now that I think about it Laoch seemed out of his mind.<br/>I have a bad feeling that something is wrong.<br/>I need to find out if Laoch is safe.<p/>I will contact you later.

I can never forgive him for what he tried to do to me...<br/>...If it wasn't for Lassar.. then...<p/>Anyway, how did you obtain this potion?<br/>It is very difficult to make...<p/>Even if you do not use it, you cannot return such a dangerous thing...<br/>I will dispose of it for you.<br/><username/>Do you understand?
1899	<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(I told Redire what Dilys told me.)<p/>What if it is marionette potion?<br/>I see...<br/>Esras must be using it to manipulate someone...<p/>As it is<username/>,<br/>What is the medicine for?<p/>...<p/>Dilys said she will dispose of it?<p/>Well, I supposed that's okay.<br/>I did not intend to use it originally.<p/>More importantly, if what the healer says is true...<p/>...<br/>Oh, it is! it is!<br/>Apparently, she seems to be right.<p/>Actually, I saw Laoch a while ago.<br/>As I said before, Laoch is my subordinate and collaborator.<p/>Indeed things have been strange with him lately...I just assumed he changed<p/>What on earth is Esras up to...?<br/><username/>,sorry but there is still more work for you to do.<p/>I will contact you when I find out more.<br/>Please be careful.

This is bad news...<br/>My sources in the castle have been disappearing one by one.<br/>Either that, or they've lost themselves like Laoch.

(He gasps.)<br/>Normally, after using those Golems...<br/>the magic on those Golems would be dispelled, but...<p/>This was a long time ago, and those Partholons<br/>used the Fire Golems at Sen Mag<br/>to beat the Fomors...<p/>The problem started from there...<br/>As you know...about those Fire Golems... (He gasps.) ...the mana that was etched into their bodies<br/>was very difficult to remove.<br/>They wreaked so much havoc...<p/>It's not as if we could destroy them ourselves...<br/>And that's when they came up with...Ceo Island... (He gasps again.)<br/>Summoning each and every one of those Golems...to a remote island...<br/>and creating that area with elements that are opposed to the Golems...effectively sealed them away from society.<p/>Yes, that means the Golems at Ceo Island are...<br/>the very Golems that fought the Fomors in Sen Mag.<br/>But for them to resume their activities now...<br/>this is definitely...an unnatural occurrence...<p/>This was caused by someone...<br/>I don't know who's responsible for this, but...<p/>I can come up with two theories behind...the reawakening of these Golems...<br/>Either there's something out there so dangerous...that those Golems at Ceo Island needed to reawaken...<p/>Or, reawakening the sealed Golems...was practice...<br/>for reawakening something even bigger...<br/>That's my theory...<p/>All magic that has to do with enabling a being to move...<br/>are based on the same theory...
1917	<username/>, did you happen to find more information? If so, then please let me know right now!<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Price listens carefully to your explanation and nods.)<p/>Hmmm...<br/>So this is what I'm getting right now...<br/>Esras is very much interested in getting her hands on ancient knowledge...<br/>and to do that, she plans on awakening Tabhartas, the key to that knowledge...<br/>and to do so, she has awakened the Golems at Ceo Island...<p/><image name='g2_Ch34_james'/>Alright, well...<br/>Since you are here and all, can you help me one more time?<br/>Do you know James from the Church of Emain Macha?<br/>Yes, the priest.<p/>He's actually an investigator sent by the Royal Court.<p/>I recently received a document from him.<br/>It was about Esras collecting enormouse amounts of gold recently.<br/>I have a feeling that whatever Esras is planning<br/>might be far more horrible than what we think it is.<p/>Go deliver the information we collected to James.<br/>Last time I saw James,<br/>he was trying really ahrd to win Craig over...<p/>I think this amount of evidence will probably be enought to do it.<p/>Go tell James what you know,<br/>and help him persuade Craig.
1918	<username/>I've been waiting on you.<br/>I've heard about Redire's story.<p/>Despite being head priest of Emain Macha,<br/>there were investigators dispatched by the Pope.<br/>And here you are, investigating allegations of Esras's tyranny...<br/>Can you tell me what you and Price have learned?<p/>Of course, we will look into what you've found on Esras.<br/>However...<p/>Esras is very powerful due to his position in the government.<br/>Emain Macha has been more prosperous because of her reign.<br/>Esras also pays her taxes,<br/>and I also began to obey her instructions.<p/>However, one cannot easily deceive the Pointiff's Court.<p/>The suspicious potions brewed in the basements of Emain Macha...<br/>The Paladin trainees who rushed to the mines in search of gold...<p/>If what you are saying is true...<p/>Esras is collecting money using the Paladins.<p/>Considering that, Gold is different from other metals, it can be used to disable magic spells.<p/>I do not know which spells Esras wants to disable,<br/>but because of how much gold Esras is gathering, it must be a powerful spell...<p/>I am very sorry, but I do not know anything else.<br/>Please don't talk to anyone else,<br/>besides Price and I about this subject.
1919	Good, I would like to see James's research.<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/>(Redire looks over James's Notes)<p/>I see...<p/>Is that so...<p/>Good, with this information,<br/>we should be able to prove Esras conspiracy in the Kingdom.<p/>This provides evidence.<br/>Be careful, Esras knows about our investigations and might be out to hurt you.
1920	Meet Craig
1921	Come visit with me. - Craig -
1922	Speak with Craig
1923	Actually...<p/>When the tragedy in Emain Macha happened,<br/>there was  rumor that Esras may have poisoned the Lord next in line to the throne.<p/>In addition...<p/>The lord has been in poor health lately, and it's getting worse...<br/>Esras won't let the healers near him,<p/>claiming that she will cure him personally.<p/>However, Esras was the one who helped my child.<br/>I want to believe this is all just a rumor, and leave it alone.<p/>...but I must know the truth.<p/><image name='g2_Ch35_esras'/>Go into the castle and keep Esras distracted.<br/>I will sneak past her and<br/>bring a healer to check on the lord.<p/>We cannot move against Esras until we know that the lord is safe.

There are several types of herbs. <br/><image name='bloody_herb'/> Red-coloured herbs are called [Bloody Herbs]. Bloody herbs contain ingredients that restores your health. <p/><image name='sunlight_herb'/> The yellow-coloured herbs are called [Sunlight herbs]. It contains ingredients that have the effect of restoring stamina, which makes them useful for nutritional supplements. <p/><image name='base_herb'/> The green-coloured herbs are called [Base Herbs].

Mana herbs, on the other hand, aren't like normal herbs. It's a herb that has absorbed the mana of Eweca. Eating it by itself does nothing. <p/> Like other herbs, it is necessary to prepare it. To prepare herbs, you need a [Potion Concoction Kit]. Since we sell these kits here, why not give one a test run? Aim to become the best herbologist!

It's nice to listen to others' requests, but it's also important to do things you enjoy. <p/> Aside from part-time jobs, and special quests, there shouldn't be any time limit on quests. There's no reason to do your quests immediately - Do you understand?

5224	...Well done. Thanks for such a comprehensive report. <p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (Tarlach reads the book again) <p/> ...I see... I was kind of suspecting this, but... so Macha actually has a vendetta against humans... <p/>...While you were busy collecting information on Macha, I, too, did some research on it.<p/>...You're aware of the legend on the Advent of the Goddess, right? Yes, the legend that the moment Morrighan arrives at Erinn, it'll be transformed into a paradise. <p/> ...The legend also states that even the dead will come back to life, so needless to say, lots of adventurers tried their hardest to bring Morrighan to Erinn, myself included... What people don't know... is that it's just one of the interpretations from the legend itself.<p/> There's more than one, actually. The other one states that it's actually not Morrighan, but rather... Macha... <p/><image name='G3_ch06_macha'/> The difference between the two is that... while one states that Morrighan, the Goddess of Love, descends upon Erinn and transforms Erinn into paradise, this one states that Macha, the Goddess of Destruction, descends upon Erinn and transform Erinn into a living hell. <p/> ...I used to think it was simply a difference in the point of view when interpreting this legend, but... with the Statue of Goddess at the dungeon being destroyed, and the stories of the possible Second Coming of Macha being floating around... I think it's just a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. <p/> Based on the information you've given me, I have decided to delve more into the Second Coming of Macha. I'll be here researching, and if I find something significant, I'll let you know. <p/> ...I don't like where this is headed... Please take care of yourself...

5235	Ohhh, you came. I have heard of your commendable work through Priest James. The reason I brought you here is because... I don't know if you heard this, but lately, the Statues of the Goddess located at various dungeons have been destroyed...  <p/> I think it's the Fomors that did it... As the word of the statues being destroyed circulated around, the appearances of the Fomors have increased greatly since. <p/> I truly believe that the Statue of the Goddess protects Erinn... That it has the power to prevent the Fomors from invading us. If the Statues are destroyed, then the horror of that devastating war from the past will soon be relived, at least that's what we think... <p/> In order to prevent that from happening, the Churches of Lymilark have all decided to join forces. We're trying to restore the destroyed Statues through the power of God. <p/> ... <p/> This is what you can do for us. I want you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed, and eliminate the Fomors inside. That way, the priests won't be disturbed in their efforts to restore the Statue. <p/> The dungeons where the Statues have been destroyed are scattered everywhere around Erinn, but I want you to first head to the dungeon near Emain Macha.<p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_aodhan'/> Aodhan the head guard will lead you to the dungeon. You should go see him immediately. Here's wishing you the best of luck, and may God protect you in every step of the way, <username/>.

5237	You're back safely. Did you run into any trouble at Coil Dungeon? <p/> Next up, it's Rundal Dungeon. I'll give you the Fomor's Command sheet that was found at Rundal Dungeon, so make the dungeon pass like last time and head to the spot at the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed. <p/> Once you clear out the Fomors in that area, a priest will enter and restore the Statue of the Goddess. <p/> Making the Rundal Dungeon Pass, like last time also requires the Command sheet, as well as Holy Water of Lymilark and Mana Herb, using the Handicraft skill to piece them all together. Rundal Dungeon is a place where the cursed pirates lay trapped... Please be careful of the Skeletons, the Mimics that resemble a treasure chest, and the weapons from the pirates that have turned into monsters themselves. <p/> After finishing the restoration of the Statue at Rundal, come back and see me, and I'll have the Fomor's Command sheet ready for you for the next dungeon.<p/>Please go ahead and start now…
5238	Now there's only one dungeon left at Emain Macha, Peaca Dungeon. I'll give you the Command Sheet that was found there, so please help us out one more time.<p/> You can make Peaca Dungeon Pass by using your Handicraft skill to combine the Command Sheet I gave you, along with Holy Water of Lymilark and Mana Herb, just like last time. <p/> Peaca Dungeon is a place where the Undead appear quite frequently. It's a dungeon infamous for having the powers from Another World transferred directly to that dungeon. You've been doing great so far, but I strongly advise you to be extra careful this time around. <p/> Once the restoration is complete, please come back and report to me. <p/> Once that's complete, your mission to restore the dungeons at the Emain Macha area will be complete.<p/>...Good luck.
5239	Great, great work. Thanks to your tireless effort, the destroyed Statues of the Goddess in dungeons around the area have all been restored. <p/> Other towns have also started the restoration process, but the Fomors seem to be putting up quite a resistance. <p/> I feel that other towns will soon hear of your work, and ask for help.  If that happens, I suggest you lend your helping hand to them. <p/> ...Best of luck to you.

5263	You're here. Thank you so much for coming. <p/> We were afraid this may happen soon, and as expected, the dungeons around Bangor are also going through the same fate. <p/> The number of the Statues of the Goddess destroyed has been increasing by the day. <p/>  Unlike other places, Bangor does not have its own army or a fleet of guards, so the dangers we'll face if the Statues aren't restored is much bigger than other towns. <p/> ...I had talked to Priest James about this matter, and he told me Wyllow, the Head Priest, have already talked to you about this. Thank goodness. <p/> I can restore the Goddess Statue no problem, but if there isn't someone that can sufficiently clear out the area from the Fomors, their forces will interrupt and affect the ritual that takes place to restore the Statues. <p/> Please help us restore the Statues at the dungeon. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_seumas'/> To get to the area where the Statues have been destroyed, please go see Seumas at the Dragon site of ruins.

It may take a little bit of time to acquire Mana Herb and the Holy Water of Lymilark... <p/> ...Everyone's been out there helping restore the dungeons and the statues, so we're currently really short on Mana Herb and the Holy Water of Lymilark. I feel bad that I can't give you any right now... <p/> Just so you know, Fiodh Dungeon is full of animals that are controlled by the Fomors. Don't underestimate them just because they are some field animals... You will find yourself in grave danger. <p/> Please come back and see me once the restoration for Fiodh Dungeon is complete. I can't personally check every part of the restoration process. <p/> I appreciate it.
5266	... you are here. <p/> (gasp, gasp) great work there... Thanks to your help, the Statues of the Goddess are restored. Thank goodness... puff. <p/> But then... (gasp, gasp)... I have been hearing some news lately that ... (gasp, gasp) concerns me greatly... <p/> I hear that... someone... huff... will come and destroy it once more... (gasp, gasp) a black knight... wearing black armors... <p/> This... huff... is really not going the way we expected to go... Please... huff... be careful... Oh, and... huff... please take care of other towns, too...

As expected, we have found Statues of Goddess that have been destroyed in dungeons around Dunbarton. <p/> First, we'll need you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed and remove the Fomors in the premise. That's when myself and other priests will hold the ritual that'll restore the Statue. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_eavan'/> For more detail, please go see Eavan at the Town Office. <p/> I'll be here working on something else, so please go see her right now.

5278	Thank you so very much. Thanks to your great work, all the dungeons around Dunbarton were able to restore the Statues of the Goddess. <p/> While we were busy restoring the Statues here, however, the dungeon at Emain Macha was ambushed by the Fomors, and the Paladin Knights took major hits while fending off the attack. <p/> I am also hearing that some the Statues that have already been restored are being destroyed again... <p/> Please hurry to Tir Chonaill, and restore the dungeon there. <p/> In the meantime, you should be contacted by the priest from there. <p/> Good luck.

5287	Oh you're here. Thank you for coming. Honestly, when I heard about your work through Wyllow, the Head Priest at the Church in Emain Macha, I was a bit shocked. <p/> I am not sure if other people talking about your work in great detail is necessary a good thing, but... what is true is that you are definitely becoming an important figure in our community. <p/> ...Ah, wait, there's no time for small talk. As expected, we have found Statues of Goddess that have been destroyed in dungeons around Dunbarton.<p/> First, we'll need you to enter the dungeon where the Statue is destroyed and remove the Fomors in the premise. That's when myself and other priests will hold the ritual that'll restore the Statue. <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_eavan'/> For more detail, please go see Eavan at the Town Office. <p/> I'll be here working on something else, so please go see her right now. Good luck.

You not only rescued the Goddess, but you have also become the Knight of Light... correct? <p/> ...What I want to discuss with you is about the Statues of the Goddess at dungeons being destroyed left and right. I had been deeply concerned about this when Wyllow the Head Priest suggested you as the one to contact. <p/> I hear that other towns have also been ambushed with this, and... Yes, the dungeons near Tir Chonaill also featured a number of destroyed Statues of the Goddess... <p/><image name='G3_ch06_guide_trefor'/> Hmmm... for more detail, you should hear it from Trefor. Priest Endelyon and I will be busy doing the restoration ritual, so... <p/> Good luck.

Please take this first.<p/><title name='NONE'/><image name='G3_ch06_infiltration_Scroll'/> (Trevor hands you a Fomor Command Scroll) <p/> Everything else is the same. Use this sheet to make a pass and enter the dungeon. Once you make the way, the priests will soon follow and take care of the rest. <p/> The Fomors at Alby Dungeon are a little more than bugs and rats, but... since the Command Sheet is found, as well as the broken Statue... <p/> I think it'll be best for you to look through everything. You can never be too careful on things like this, you know. <p/> Since Alby Dungeon is literally right there, you don't need to report to me when the Statue is fully restored, okay? <p/> Keep up the good work!!

5321	I have asked you to make your way here because I have a request for you. <p/> I think you'd be... sigh... the one person that'd understand where I am coming from, so that's why I summoned all the courage I have to ask you this. <p/> I am sure you are aware of it, but... but... I... was unable to save my comrades before... and not only that... I used my injured body as an excuse... <p/>...to not even seek for them ever since. <p/> ...I just couldn't look them in the eye. <p/> ...I just feel so guilty at the thought of meeting with the people...  that are associated with my fallen comrades... <p/> ...I don't even know if there's a sufficient way to apologize for my actions... <p/> I want to see Mari... no, Nao. Just once... that's all I need...  <p/> I just want to see her with my very own eyes, and know that she is alive and well. <p/><title name='NONE'/> (Tarlach takes something out) <p/> ...and...  I...really want to tell her...that I'm sorry... for not being there for her when she needed me... <p/> ... <p/> Out of all these people in Erinn... out of the ones from Tuatha Dé Danann... if you find someone that knows Nao, ...then can you please ask that person... <p/> ...how...to...meet up with her...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Mari_arrow'/> ...This... is an item that Mari used to use... I don't know how much help you'll get from this, but...  I'd like for you to find out by showing this around... <p/> ...please... please do this for me...
5322	<npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (You tell Duncan Tarlach's story) <p/> ...I had no idea he was really down on himself like that... That was probably her destiny... <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Nao'/> ...Nao is doing fine. In her mind, she does not think of this world the way Tarlach believes she feels... <p/> Mari is already the kind of being that has long surpassed the boundaries of this world... Nao can't put herself directly in contact with people in Erinn... people like me... I don't know what that's the case, but...  <p/> Only people like you that have been led here from Soul Stream... the ones that have been referred to as the people from another star... the Milletians... she can only help people like you... Us? We can't even see her... <p/> But if we're just talking about seeing her, then... I have to say there might be a way... in order to do that, I need... the... Holy Potion of Lymilark. <p/><image name='G3_ch08_s_potion'/> It's a potion... that brings the power from another world to Erinn, and expands on it... That's the only way I can see Nao... through that... <p/> ...I'll teach you how to make the Holy Potion of Lymilark. Your job is to make it, and bring it to Tarlach. <p/> <image name='G3_ch08_Tarlach'/> ...I'd like for you to finally alleviate some of the pain he has carried with for a long time... <p/> ... <p/> ...Please wait for a bit... well, I think it's finally time for you to know this. Please listen carefully... <p/> Now that some time had passed since the lord of Emain Macha passed away, ...I'll tell you a story that you might not have heard before... <p/><image name='G3_ch08_burning'/> Do you know who is responsible... for hurting Nao's father, while personally slaying her mother...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Emain_lord'/> ...It was actually the lord of Emain Macha... He was too blinded by power and greed, and... he wanted to eliminate Mores's presence from Erinn, and he wound up snatching away everything that was supposed to be for Mores.<p/> He could not accept the fact that a common folk like Mores was going to achieve more than he ever would... <p/> That's why... he did not allow Mores to enjoy what was rightfully his in his lifetime... and instead, allowed him to be glorified as the warrior that saved the world... <p/> ...after his death...<p/> ...I understand if you are having a hard time accepting this... but know that this is all true... If this story ever reached the lord's ears... then this small town would not have been able to survive his wrath... <p/> ...That is the reason why this old man had kept his mouth shut for the longest time... <p/> ...My story is over. ...Please go see Tarlach.
5323	Potion of the Soul
5324	The Holy Potion of Lymilark can be made by using the Handicraft Skill to combine [Spirit-Viewing Power], which can be obtained through the Crystal Ball at Dunbarton Library; [Spirit-Forming Bottle], which can be found inside the Rabbie dungeon, and [Spirit Hearing Water], which can be made by combining one [white herb], one [bloody herb], and one [mana herb].

I'll find out myself. <p/> ...I will never, ever... forget the good deed you've done for me...
5328	James's Request
5329	I heard a story from Price. Did you know Goddess Macha is creating a dark army? I need to talk to you about something involving this, please come see me in Emain Macha.  - James
5330	Talk with James
5331	Speak with Kristell
5332	Talk with Duncan
5333	Talk with James
5334	Thank you for coming. While I was rummaging through old records, I noticed something very interesting... and I think it's something you should know. Yes... it's about Macha's resurrection. <p/> ...Straight to the point, yes, she has resurrected, and is now waiting to be reawakened. <p/> ... <p/> ...Do you remember... how the whole tragedy of Emain Macha started in the first place...? <p/><image name='G3_ch08_fomor_baby'/> ...It all started when Esras ordered Redire to kidnap a Fomor kid, causing Dark Lord to attack in hopes of rescuing the kid... <p/> ... <p/> ...That kid, I believe, was in fact, the reincarnated Macha. I looked through every possibility, and...  that's the only plausible explanation for this... <p/> That kid... was the key to the revival and the prospering of the Fomors... in the eyes of the Fomors,  it only makes sense that the kid not be in the hands of the humans. <p/> ...The series of broken Statues are only just the beginning. The Fomors plan on reviving Macha, connect Erinn to Another World, and set this world ablaze. <p/> But then again, based on a number of signs that were shown throughout, I don't believe this kid was truly awakened into Macha. If so, then don't you think we still have a chance? <p/> ...Yes, the plan is for us to stop this kid from turning into a fully-grown Macha. Either we find the kid and bring her here, or if there's an item needed for awakening, we can destroy those... <p/> ...That's why I have a request for you. Please take this information I just told you, and discuss this with the Priestess of Dunbarton. <p/><image name='G3_ch13_kristell'/> ...She's very knowledgeable on Fomors, so I am sure she can give you a pointer or two on what's required for reawakening, and the measures needed to prevent this from happening.
5335	What...? You're here as a favor to Priest James? Macha's revival... and the way to stop the Goddess of Destruction from the reawakening?<p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (You tell James' Story to Kristell) <p/>Okay... a child Fomor that is suspected of being Macha... I see... I can see how that works... <p/> ...Now that I think of it, that story reminds me of something... a long time ago... there was an ancient spell that apparently transports a form of life into another body through a medium. <p/> ...I don't know the full details of it, but... if we can find out what that medium is, and destroy it... then maybe we can prevent the transfer from happening...no? <p/> ...I honestly don't know anything more about this. <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Duncan'/> If you want more details on this, then... <br/>...how about visiting the chief of Tir Chonaill? <p/> I also heard a lot about the Chief through Priest Meven. I heard that he's very experienced in life who is also very knowledgeable in that area. <p/> I am confident that the chief of Tir Chonaill... can really give you some helpful pointers on this.
5336	A form of life transferred into another body...?  And the priest of Dunbarton told you to talk to me about it...? <p/> ...I think Priest Meven is spreading some incorrect information... sigh... <p/> ..... <p/> The reawakening of Macha does NOT involve a live body with a different spirit transferred into it, like you said...  <p/> It's more like... a chosen body selected to be the median for the spirit of the God, and slowly becoming one with it... <p/> Of course, this process does not happen just like that... The medium used for that... the Wisdom of the Ancients... <p/> It's a set of stairs made with the power of magic by the wise men from way back, climbed up as a God-like presence... <p/>  Yes... if it's used to reawaken the chosen girl into a god-like presence, then... it has to be the Wisdom of the Ancients... <p/>  ...I am sure you've noticed it by now... <p/> ...That's also how Nao became the way she is today...
5337	Did you manage to find out more about it? <p/><npcportrait name='NONE'/><title name='NONE'/> (Tell him what Duncan and Meven) <p/> Wisdom of the Ancients...? A human being transformed into God...?  And that's what's required of Macha's revival...?  <p/><image name='G3_ch08_Esras'/> ...That...  ...was what Esras was looking for... <p/> ..... <p/> ...I feel like the pieces are finally starting to fit. The reason why Esras unearthed Tabhartas was because of the Wisdom of the Ancients... so that means... she wanted to become the God that governs the world herself...?! <p/><image name='G3_ch08_tabartas'/> I see... Tabhartas is the gatekeeper that protects the Wisdom of the Ancients...  ...If she knew how to effectively control Tabhartas, then she would have been able to find the Wisdom of the Ancients. <p/> ...Okay, then... now that Tabhartas is nowhere to be found, maybe it's already at the hands of the Fomors...! <p/> ...This is really not good... The exact name for Wisdom of the Ancients is... Lia Fail. <p/> ...If Lia Fail ends up in the hands of the Fomors, then we must either take it back, or destroy it ourselves. Otherwise, Macha will be reawakened, and literally all hell will break loose in Erinn! <p/> Please find out where Lia Fail is located. We need to locate Lia Fail, and make sure no one else can use it. <p/> I hear that in Ceo Island, there's a Fomor that actually speaks the human language. Please ask the Fomor for directions to Lia Fail... and... please, please prevent the resurrection of Macha from happening. <p/> I will report this to the officials. Good luck.

5957	石像に関する本には<br/>なかなか面白そうな事が書かれているのよ。<p/>特にその中でも、戦士、神官、偉人の石像に関するものが面白くて<br/>良く憶えているわ。<p/>ここから一番近い石像は神官かしら。<br/>キャンプからメイズ平原に向かって北東側へ進むと、大きな花の模様が見えるはず。<p/>その近くに手を前に組んで並んだ３体の石像があるんだけど<br/>真ん中にあるターバンを巻いた石像をスケッチすればいいとはずよ。<p/>スケッチしてきたら、わたしが上手く描けているか<br/>チェックしてあげるわ。
5958	神官像のスケッチは上手くできたのかしら？<br/>似たような石像が多いから、手の位置や顔で判断しないといけない時があるのよ。<p/>偉人の石像は神官の石像と違って、後ろに手を組んでいるから<br/>王様のような身分の高い人の石像だと言われているの。<p/>偉人の石像は神官の石像よりも<br/>更に北東へ進んだところにあるわ。<p/>偉人の石像の内、頭の先がとがった石像があるから<br/>それをスケッチしてくれば見てあげる。<p/>ちなみに神官像の近くに草が生えていない部分があるけど<br/>気付いたかしら？<p/>神官像の近くを高いところからみると<br/>大きな花の絵が描かれているのよ。<p/>他にもイリアには広大な大地に描かれた絵があるから<br/>余裕があったら探してみるのもいいわよ。
5959	残りは戦士の石像ね。<br/>戦士の石像は、平原を越えてムユ砂漠の北部にあるらしいわ。<p/>正確な場所はわからないから、これ以上は助けてあげられないけど<br/>冒険者達の話によると、石像は石像を導くとの話があるのよ。<p/>巨大な地上絵の近くにも石像はあるらしいから<br/>今までの石像をヒントに戦士の石像を探してみるといいかもね。
5960	その様子だと戦士の石像を見つけたのね。<br/>…なるほど、神官の石像は偉人の石像を指して<br/>偉人の石像は戦士の石像をみているとはね。<p/>それをヒントに他の石像も見つけられるかもしれないわ。<br/>すごい発見よ、<username/>。<p/>でも、今回の目標は石像のスケッチだったから<br/>今までの調査結果をクエストボードに報告しなさい。<p/><username/>のお陰で色んな情報を得られたから<br/>わたしにとっても今回の探検は成功という事になるのかしら。

5968	意外と本の話が本当だったのね。<br/><username/>さんが調べてきたものと<br/>本の内容が一致するんだよ。<p/>本に書いてある通り、巨大な鳥を復活させることってできるのかな～！<br/>あと、その鳥をどうやって封印できたのか<br/>についてももうちょっと詳しく調べてみる価値があるね。<p/>調査を進めて、必要なモノがあったら、<br/><username/>さんにまたお願いするからね。宜しく！

5975	遠くまで見回ってご苦労さん！<username/>さん。<br/>もう一つの剣を持っている石像が発見されたらしいね。<p/>地上の巨大な絵と<br/>その周りに石像があるのは確認できたけど、<br/>以前、調べた夜になると光る壁に閉じ込められた鳥<br/>の遺跡との関係がなかなか見つからないね。<p/>巨大な鳥の復活の話は、魅力的だけど、<br/>具体的な証拠が出るまでは<br/>もっと深いところまで調べてみるのは後にしたほうがいいと思うんだ。<p/>鳥の復活に執着し過ぎないで、<br/>別の視線で見て今までの冒険の<br/>結果を分析してみたほうがいいかもしれない。<p/>今回もわたしの代わりに調べてくれてありがとう。<username/>さん。

6042	朝、昼、夕方、夜を象徴するというのが、<br/>該当する時間に日時計の影が差す<br/>方向を言うものだったね。<p/>あと、この建造物は、時間になると<br/>上段にある模様に変化があるのね。<p/>調べてきた絵を見ると建造物の上段にあるこの模様は、<br/>まるで人の頭から光線が出るような感じ…！<br/>この人が太陽を象徴するのかな？<p/>太陽が描いてある門だから、<br/>太陽の門って名づけてもいいだろうね。<br/>そういえば、砂漠には太陽と関係があるものが多いね～。

6053	こんにちは。<username/>さん。石化したガントレットの調査依頼を見てきたのね？<p/>最近<username/>さんのように冒険に励んでる冒険者から<br/>石型のガントレットを手に入れたよ。<p/>でも、わたしが持っていたヘビのガントレットという本の内容と似てるような気がして…。<br/>確実ではないけど、これが本当にヘビのガントレットなら、<br/>ヘビと関係のある遺跡に対して何か反応があるはずだよ。<p/>まず、この石化したガントレットを持って、ムユ砂漠の北側、<br/>巨大な４本足の動物の模様近くにあるヘビが彫られた柱に行って、<br/>特別な反応があるかどうか見てみてちょうだい。<p/>あ！反応を確認するには、<br/>わたしが今渡す石化したガントレットを常に持ち歩いてね。
6054	石化が一部除かれたのね。<br/>ガントレットを持ってヘビが彫られた柱を叩いたら、<br/>ガントレットの石化が除かれたって？<br/>それじゃ～、本当本にあるヘビのガントレットだね。<p/>ヘビと関係あるほかの遺跡に行って残った石化を除くことができるかも。<br/>カルー森の南側、巨大なヘビの模様がある周りに<br/>壁を這うヘビという遺跡があるそうね。<p/>壁を這うヘビの遺跡に行って、<br/>石化したガントレットの残った石化を除くことってできるかな…。<br/>確かめてみてくれるかい？
6055	あ～手首まで石化が除かれたのね。<br/>石化が除かれた手首の上にヘビの鱗の飾りがちらっと見えるね。<br/>話だけ聞いたけど、ヘビのガントレットを直接手に入れられるとは…。<p/>でも、まだ石化が全部除かれたわけじゃなくて<br/>このままでは使えないと思うよ。<p/>カルー森には普段隠れていて、<br/>Ｌロッドで見つけられるヘビの柱があるよ…。<br/>それをまた調べてみれば石化をもっと除けるんじゃないのかな？<p/>隠されているヘビの柱を<br/>Ｌロッドで探して<br/>ヘビのガントレットとの反応があるかどうか調べてみてちょうだい。<p/>ヘビの柱はどこにあるかわかるよね？<br/>カルー森の巨大なヘビの模様と巨大な木の模様の間に<br/>あるからね～。
6056	素晴らしいね～！<br/>ガントレットが石化から完全に除かれたね。<br/>でも、まだ装着できないのは<br/>石化以外に封印が除かれてないからかな…？<p/>本を見ると暗闇のヘビの鱗が<br/>ヘビのガントレットを目覚めさせるという内容があったね。<br/>たぶ～んガントレットの鱗の上にある目の形の紋章が閉ざされてるのから見て、<br/>まだ封印がかかってるかもしれないよ。<p/>暗闇のヘビの鱗が要るらしいけど、<br/>まだイリアで暗闇のヘビっていう動物を見たっていう報告は<br/>全然ないね。<br/>鱗を手に入れられるのはカルー森の森のトカゲくらいかな…？<p/>伝説と噂は正確な内容じゃない場合があるから、<br/>黒森トカゲの鱗で封印を除けることを祈らないと。<br/>このガントレットはわたしが保管しとくよ。<br/>カルー森に行って、黒森トカゲの鱗を5個くらい手に入れて来てね。

6289	Report to Quest Board
6290	Yes? Gray-tailed Mongooses are found to the northeast of camp,<br/>just past the Big-eared Aardvark breeding grounds up ahead.<br/>Some people think mongooses are cute,<br/>but because they are wild animals, they pose a threat to humans.
6291	Collect 5 Gray-tailed Monsoose Fur
6292	You're aware of the different colored mongooses, right? According to mongoose ecology theory, it appears that they have different colored tails and legs based on diet and habitat. But let's obtain some fur and investigate this a little ourselves.
6293	Speak with Alexina

6295	Mongoose types can be differentiated by the colors of their tails.<br/>From the base camp, the Gray-tailed Mongooses<br/>are just a bit north.<br/>You should be able to find them quickly.
6296	Black-tailed Mongoose

6307	Collect 5 Black-tailed Mongoose Fur
6308	Among the mongooses, there is a variety with a black tail and legs. And of the mongooses, Black-tailed Mongoose Fur is the best material for brushes. Brushes made with Black-tailed Mongoose Fur are called "Walking Master" brushes - half of a good brush is the fur that goes into making it.

6315	Have you been investigating Brown-tailed Mongooses?<br/>While it's true that mongooses capture and eat snakes,<br/>seeing them for real doesn't scare me at all.<br/>Among the many types of mongooses, the Brown-tailed Mongoose appears to be the most meek.<p/>They are all around the camp,<br/>but if you take a left out of the camp toward the foot of the Nubes Mountains<br/>or to the right toward Kaypi Canyon, you should have no trouble finding them.
6316	Defeat 10 Brown-tailed Mongooses
6317	There's probably no one else in the world that hates rodents as much as me, but I -really- hate the mongooses that are around the base camp. Imagine a bunch of rats surrounding a baby calf.

6322	Collect 5 Brown-tailed Mongoose Fur
6323	Have you seen the mongooses? They appear meek, but in reality even fierce beasts and poisonous snakes keep their distance. That's why many explorers choose to wear clothing made of their furs, believing that it will protect them from such hidden dangers. As such, mongoose fur is in short supply. Would you go out to the prairie beyond the base camp and collect some?
6324	Speak with Alexina
6325	Bring 5 Brown-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board
6326	Because the mongooses possess an antidote material in their bodies,<br/>it appears that they easily capture poisonous snakes.<br/>They will not attack unless provoked - they are gentle animals that will also not attack from a distance.<p/>The Brown-tailed Mongooses are all around camp,<br/>if you take a left out of camp toward the foot of the Nubes Mountains <br/>or a right toward Kaypi Canyon, you should have no trouble finding them.

6333	Defeat 10 Blue-tailed Mongooses
6334	I've collected many reports regarding mongooses. It appears that they can catch even fast-moving snakes, but its difficult to grasp the mongooses' hunting habits from this alone. If you can fight them directly, would you teach me your method of doing battle?
6335	Defeat 10 Blue-tailed Mongooses
6336	Collect 5 Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur
6337	I've collected all sorts of different colored mongoose furs and crafted accessories out of them. I don't use them, but I think they made good gifts for my friends when they were just-starting adventurers. I can't take my eyes off of the Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur. It really calms me down.
6338	Bring 5 Blue-tailed Mongoose Fur to the Quest Board

6349	Collect 5 White-tailed Mongoose Fur
6350	I've heard that among the young adventurers in Iria, White-tailed Mongoose Fur is popularly believed to protect the love between a man and a woman. I've also heard that the fur is starting to be regarded as a symbol of luck and safety. Because of this, White-tailed Mongoose Fur has been in short supply and has become harder to obtain.
6351	Speak with Alexina

6370	The White-eared Bush Boars that you find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] may look docile and adorable, but when they are in an attack mode, they can be ruthless. Once they start charging towards a human being, they won't stop until the person is completely knocked out, so a lot of explorers get hurt in the process. If you're stuck in a forest covered with tall trees, it's near impossible to avoid their attacks.

The most common rumor states that deep in the night, with the Eweca filling the air, you can hear a metal-screeching scream coming from those rocks, with a white ghost slowly crawling out of the structure.

6454	A long, long time ago, there was a pair of bears that were deeply in love. Their love for one another was unmatched, but that passion also led to constant pain caused to one another.

It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White-striped Desert Spiders leave.
6490	Defeat 10 White-striped Desert Spiders
6491	Report to Quest Board
6492	Deliver 5 White-striped Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6493	I process the venom sac of a spider to make a tight, light gold sack. It's very elastic, so it stores a lot more gold than sacks made out of cow skin or horse skin. I'm thinking of making a wallet or a mask out of it down the road. If you happen to acquire some White-striped Desert Spider venom sacs [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], please send them to me.
6494	Gather up 5 White-striped Desert Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6495	White Spider
6496	I believe that the animals living in Iria are more like monsters than wild animals. There are some ecologists out there that these creatures all share similar genes to the animals we come to love, but these creatures... if nothing else, they're worse than the Fomors. Same with the white spiders at Iria.

6500	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White Desert Spiders leave

6502	Report to Quest Board
6503	Deliver 5 White Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6504	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used. I feel that if I study a Venom Sac from a White Desert Spider, then I might be able to finally find a connection between Venom Sacs and web sacs.

6506	Black Spider
6507	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used.

6510	Defeat 10 Black Desert Spiders
6511	Hey there! Are you aware that Black Desert Spiders carry venom so unbelievably potent that it's plain shocking? They are so potent that a teaspoon full of it can wipe out Dunbarton in an instant. When I went to [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert], I see these Black Desert Spiders roaming around recklessly.
6512	Defeat 10 Black Desert Spiders
6513	Report to Quest Board
6514	Deliver 5 Black Desert Spider Venom Sacs
6515	I know this sounds crazy, but I plan on acquiring some Black Desert Spider venom sacs at [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert] and pour them into a lake. Don't look at me like that. There's a reason for it. Apparently, one of the components of the spider venom can actually purify water, among other things.

6517	(You complete the quest you were asked to do)
6518	Brown Mushroom of Terror
6519	There have been reports that a giant mushroom is attacking people. Obviously it's not a regular mushroom, but a giant mushroom with 8 huge feet sporting fangs. The scariest thing I heard about them is that this mushroom would wrap up innocent travelers with mysterious strings, and proceed to suck their blood. Wow... if you aren't scared after hearing this, then can you find that mushroom for me?

6521	Report to Quest Board
6522	Defeat 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders
6523	Spiders don't offer too much threat to the explorers, but the explorers do run into some tight situations when running into a sticky cobweb in between the trees in a forest. For the sake of other explorers, I want you to eliminate 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest].
6524	Defeat 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders
6525	Report to Quest Board
6526	Deliver 5 Brown Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs
6527	When you slay those spiders in Iria, you'll acquire a venom sac from time to time. The venom from Forest Mushroom Spider is actually used to create an antidote potion. Lately I have been working on creating one of my own, so I have been gathering up Brown Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]. Please gather up those venom sacs for me, and be careful of their sharp teeth and claws.
6528	Gather up 5 Brown Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6529	Red Mushroom
6530	If you are lost along the trails, the first thing you should do is to quickly find out where you currently are. That way, you will not lose your sense of direction. I remember once when I got lost, I noticed a giant red mushroom out of the corner of my eye. I used it as a reference marker as I tried to make my way, but I soon realized something about it was odd. It was as if the mushroom had its own set of legs, because it kept getting further and further away from me. What if that mushroom really wasn't one?

6536	Report to Quest Board
6537	Deliver 5 Red Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs
6538	The Red Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs that can be found [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] are coveted more for the sac itself, as opposed to the venom inside. Since it's a sac that holds that potent venom, the durability must be outstanding to say the least.
6539	Gather up 5 Red Forest Mushroom Spider Venom Sacs, and deliver them to the Quest Board
6540	In search of the blue mushroom
6541	I am a renowned expert in mushroom-related delicacies in Dunbarton, and I have used pretty much every kind of mushroom for my dishes. I hear that at Karu Forest in Iria, there's a giant, moving blue mushroom, and I am intrigued by it. Can you dig up some information on it for me?

6545	It hasn't been long since I started studying the Green Forest Mushroom Spiders. At first, I thought they were just giant mutant spiders, but the more I studied them, the more I found out about these creatures. I have also realized that they are a legitimate threat to mankind here.

Head over to a region [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] and eliminate those Black Forest Mushroom Spiders that keep standing in the explorers' ways, and make this place a better place to live for us all!

7016	When you enter [a particular site of ruins in Karu Forest], you'll run into a Stone Imp that's even more powerful than most. They may look like a regular Stone Imp, but they are actually much tougher to defeat, so a lot of explorers seem to have trouble with them.
7017	Eliminate 10 Powerful Stone Imps
7018	Report to Quest Board
7019	Eliminate 1 Glowing Pot-Belly Spider
7020	I've heard that people who have been to the deepest parts of [Karu Forest Ruins] have witnessed there a Glowing Pot-Belly Spider. There's nothing more shocking to explorers than the sight of light from the middle of nowhere, and the light's origin is a mystery.
7021	Eliminate 1 Glowing Pot-Belly Spider
7022	Report to Quest Board
7023	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
7024	At [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a Stone Hound there that glows unlike others. No one knows exactly what it is, and since no one knows about it, it poses as a serious threat to explorers that visit the ruins.
7025	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
7026	Report to Quest Board
7027	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Bison
7028	The fear you experience when you face the Glowing Stone Bison is indescribable. I do not wish that on anyone. Please eliminate the Glowing Stone Bison that can be found at [Karu Forest Ruins].
7029	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Bison
7030	Report to Quest Board
7031	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Zombie
7032	Glowing Stone Zombies are the most mysterious creatures you can ever find. No one knows anything about it, and so many people have visited the [Karu Forest Ruins] in hopes of figuring out the mysterious glow it produces. Most of them wound up never coming back out of the ruins.
7033	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Zombie
7034	Report to Quest Board
7035	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Imp
7036	The term 'light' usually symbolizes purity, the power that drives away what is evil and corrupt in this world... but after seeing the Glowing Stone Imp first hand at [Karu Forest Ruins]... I realized that the opposite may be true as well.

7039	내 머리는 돼지털
7040	학교에 갔더니 내 머리카락을 보고 돼지 털 돼지 털 하는데 곱게 자란 저로서는 도무지 그 뜻을 알 수가 없네요. 제 머리카락과 비교해 직접 확인해보고 싶은데 작은 귀 땅돼지 털 5개만 구해다 줄 수 있을까요? 음...이렇게 힘들게 부탁할 필요까지 있겠냐고요? 당연하죠! 나는 소중하니까요.
7041	작은 귀 땅돼지 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7042	흰 덤불 멧돼지 털 5개 수집
7043	미술용 붓들은 동물 털을 사용해 만들어진답니다. 말, 다람쥐, 돼지 등등 다양한 동물의 털이 사용되는데 그 종류에 따라 붓이 종이에 닿는 느낌도 달라진다고 하네요. 최근 이리아에서 새롭게 등장한 흰 덤불 멧돼지 털이 미술 재료상의 관심을 끌고 있는 건 어쩌면 자연스러운 일이겠지요.
7044	흰 덤불 멧돼지 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7045	흰 사막 여우 털 5개 수집
7046	가장 향기로운 향수는 언제나 가장 작은 병에 담겨있기 마련이지요. 흰색 사막 여우의 털이 그렇게 값이 나가는 이유도 이와 비슷하지 않을까요?
7047	흰 사막 여우 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7048	황금 꼬리 몽구스 털 5개 수집
7049	엄밀하게 말하면 일반 몽구스의 털이나 황금 꼬리 몽구스의 털이나 품질에 있어 차이는 크지 않아요. 그런데도 유독 황금 꼬리 몽구스의 털을 구해달라는 고객들이 많네요. 그건 아무래도 희소성 때문이겠지요?
7050	황금 꼬리 몽구스 털 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7051	황금 숲 도마뱀 비늘 15개를 수집
7052	황금 숲 도마뱀의 비늘은 실제 황금보다 더 값어치가 나가죠. 황금 숲 도마뱀만 전문적으로 사냥하는 사람들이 생겨났을 정도로 수집가들 사이에서 인기가 좋답니다.
7053	황금 숲 도마뱀 비늘 15개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달

7055	거대 황금 숲 버섯 거미에서 다른 버섯 거미들과 마찬가지로 독 주머니가 발견되고 있다네. 이것은 거대 황금 숲 버섯 거미가 숲 버섯 거미의 변종이 아닐까 하는 내 가설을 뒷받침하는 부분이지. 물론 좀 더 연구가 필요하겠지만... 아무래도 정확한 결론을 내기 위해서는 독 주머니들을 모아 분석을 해봐야겠네.
7056	거대 황금 숲 버섯 거미 독주머니 5개를 수집하여 퀘스트 보드에 전달
7057	우두머리 하이에나의 털 5개 수집
7058	무슨 이유에선지는 모르겠지만 하이에나 털은 의외로 인기가 없어요. 하지만 우두머리 하이에나만큼은 예외지요. 무엇보다 녀석의 목 언저리에 솟아있는 풍성한 갈기 만큼은 최상급으로 쳐주거든요.

7060	늑대 무늬 사막 거미 독주머니 5개 수집
7061	늑대 무늬 사막 거미에게 독주머니가 있다는 사실은 아주 최근에 와서야 밝혀지게 된 사실입니다. 늑대 무늬 사막 거미의 공격적인 성격이 이 독주머니에서 나오는 거라 예상하고 있는 저로서는 좀 더 실험을 해봐야 알 수 있을 거 같아요. 이를 위해 독주머니가 필요합니다.

7292	宝箱も見つけるのが大変な上<br/>宝箱からガントレット模様の石もなかなか出ないのに…<br/>大変でしたね。<p/>多くの探検家たちが発見し、私に持ってきた<br/>このガントレット模様の石をいろいろ調査していたら、<br/>偶然トカゲの鱗で石化を解くことができるという事実を発見しました。<p/>詳しいことは、カルー森にいる白森トカゲの鱗を5個<br/>持ってきてくれたら教えてあげますね。<br/>石化を解くのに必ず必要な材料です。<p/>そして…<username/>さんが持ってきてくれたガントレット模様の石は<br/>私が預かっていますね。

7743	<show_dir pos='170000 177000' pitch='15'/>The right side of the camp will not be too far from the young Brown-tailed Mongoose.<br/>Every time you (play something), you will increase your Fighter skills level.<br/>Then, your Fighter proficiency will be increased from Novice to rank F.<br/>If you have never (battled?) before, I think attacking 10 times should be sufficient?<p/>By the way, after gaining enough proficiency,<br/>open your skill window and be sure to click the yellow Learn button!
7744	<username/>, is this your first time learning these skills？<br/>There are many skills to learn in the future.<br/>Increasing your Fighter skills can improve your strength.<p/>Learning and ranking skills consume AP,<br/>so be sure to think carefully about your skill choices... <br/>You can learn other skills later.

Move your mouse to the bottom<br/>to click the skill button.<br/>You can also use the S key.<p/>You see the rest of your skills, right?<br/>Because we're currently in a conversation, you cannot use the skill, but you can use it afterwards.<br/>In the skills window, click or drag the skill icon<br/>to the shortcut bar, or you can use a shortcut key instead.<p/>The Rest skill is mainly used to restore health.<br/>Besides the ability to restore health,<br/>another helpful ability is that it can treat your injuries.<p/>Mana is the only one that cannot be immediately restored.<br/>When night falls and Eweca rises, mana will regenerate.<br/>However, during the day, staying near the Mana Tunnel will quickly regenerate mana.<p/>If you raise the rank of Rest, your maximum health value will increase<p/>There are a variety of skills to rank, however ranking skills blindly may leave you with regrets<br/>,so plan accordingly.<p/>It's our first time meeting, so I may have said too much...<br/>but if you have any other questions, you may come find me.

Looking forward to it?
7760	It isn't easy to catch the young Brown-tailed Mongoose?<br/><username/>...See it is  difficult to train fighter skills.<br/>Blindly attacking will give the enemy a chance to counterattack.<br/>... Firstly, it is critical that you defend the other's attack, before counterattacking.<p/>This skill is called Defense.<br/>You seem to have a somewhat decent understanding of Defense, although it could use some work.<br/>so I'll just tell you.<p/>Defense is a commonly used skill, so it is best to set a shortcut for it.<br/>Simply put, the Defense skill's greatest ability<br/>is to resist and withstand the enemy's attack,<br/>you should use it upon your first opportunity.<p/>Remember that defense isn't capable of withstanding all attacks,<br/>But you should use it when given the chance.<image name='Die'/>... There is strength in patience<br/>Keep practicing with the defense skills.<p/>Once you master the defense skill<br/>come see me and I will teach you about other combat skills.

7778	キャンプファイアについては聞いたことあります？<br/>キャンプファイアをするには、まず薪が必要です。<br/>とりあえず周辺で薪を5本探してきてください。<p/>初めてで慣れないかもしれませんが、<br/>意外と簡単ですよ。<p/>まず私が斧をあげますので、それを右手に持って<br/>周りの木をクリックしてください。<br/>そうすると、カーソルが斧の形に変わるので<br/>そのまま続けてクリックすれば、薪を集めることができます。<p/>薪集めは近くの場所で簡単にできると思いますので、<br/>あまり遠くまでいく必要はありませんよ。<br/>では、やってみましょう！<p/>
7779	どうでしたか？ 簡単だったでしょう？<br/>薪を持ってきてくれてありがとうございます。<br/>いただいた薪は、キャンプファイアのとき使いますね。

7785	<username/>さん、お手伝いいただいて本当にありがとうございます。<br/>お礼に、キャンプファイアがうまくできるようになる本を差し上げます。<p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>薪を集めてこのスキルを使うと、キャンプファイアをすることができます。<br/>キャンプファイアの周りで休憩すると<br/>生命力やスタミナ、負傷も早く回復しますよ。<p/><image name='npctalk_skill_campfire'/>あ…そしてキャンプファイアでは<br/>持っている食べ物もみんなで分け合うことができます。<br/>キャンプファイアで食べ物を食べるときは、キャンプをみんなで囲む<br/>キャンプシェアリングするのも良いですよ。

7788	Talk with Effie
7789	<username/>さん、メイキングマスタリってご存知ですか？<br/>メイキングマスタリとは、採集や物作りに共通して要求されるスキルのことです。<p/>メイキングマスタリをマスターすると、<br/>スタミナと採集時の成功率が上がります。<br/>そしてDexも上がるので、魔法を使う方ならさらにお得なスキルなんです。<p/>これは、意識的に何かをするスキルではなく、<br/>今後<username/>さんが何かを作ったり、採集したりするときに<br/>無意識のうちに使われるスキルです。<p/>私との話を終えたら、Qキーを押して<br/>クエストウィンドウのクエストの完了ボタンを押してみてください。<br/>メイキングマスタリが使えるようになっていますよ。

8025	うーん…首の短い太ったロバか…。<br/><username/>さん、もしかして聞き間違えたんじゃないの？<p/>多分、メイズ平原にいる大耳ツチブタのことじゃないかなと思うけど…。<br/>大耳ツチブタは、このベースキャンプから<br/>そんなに離れていない平原でよくみかけるよ。<p/>大耳ツチブタは、耳が特に発達したツチブタで、<br/>小さな音にもすごく敏感なんだ。<br/>すぐ興奮するから十分に気をつけたほうがいいよ。
8026	Pigs have always been a symbol of wealth, but they also represent negative things like greed, lust, and anger. The pigs in Iria are exceptionally negative in that regard, and they are prone to harming the residents of the camp. Please head over to the [prairie not far from the camp] and slay 10 Big-eared Aardvarks for us.
8027	ブタの気が荒いのは、その暗い属性のせいなのか…それはわからないけど、<br/>イリアのツチブタが特に凶暴なのは確か！<p/>最近、周りの人もたくさん被害にあっていて…。<br/>大耳ツチブタは、ベースキャンプ近くの<br/>平原でよく目撃されるよ。
8028	Have you ever heard of a creature called a Big-eared Aardvark? It looks like a pig, except it pays so much attention to its claws that some of them sport a colorful set of nails! That may be the reason why their claws are considered a collector's item. I'll give you a premium price on it, so how about getting me 5 Big-eared Aardvark Claws? You can find them at the [prairie not far from the camp].
8029	この大耳ツチブタは、ここベースキャンプから<br/>さほど離れていない平原に住んでいるんだ。<p/>大耳ツチブタは、耳が特に発達したツチブタで、<br/>小さな音にもすごく敏感なんだ。<br/>すぐ興奮するから十分に気をつけたほうがいいよ。
8030	Lately I have been hearing a sudden increase in the number of Black Aardvarks around the area. Sometimes, they even come close to the Camp and rummage through travelers' bags. The damages haven't been too significant yet, but if we leave them as they are right now, who knows what will happen next? Please find those Black Aardvarks at the [prairie located in between the Camp and the giant flower mark] and defeat 10 of them.
8031	黒ツチブタは、キャンプと巨大な花の模様の絵の<br/>中間でよく見かけます。<br/>やっぱりメイズ平原の近くにキャンプがあるから<br/>こんな事故が頻繁に起こるんでしょうね。
8032	I'm a zoologist primarily studying the animals of Iria. I heard that aardvarks dig up the ground to find food, and I want to study more about their claws; what they look like, and how they work. Please head to the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark], where the Black Aardvarks can be found, and get 5 of their claws for me.
8033	さあ…。<br/>ツチブタが土を掘って餌を探してるって話は初耳だねぇ。<br/>黒ツチブタなら、北東側に向かってずっと進むと<br/>キャンプと巨大な花の模様の中間にある平原で見られるはずよ。
8034	Have you ever seen a creature with a horn on its back in Iria? Well apparently, an animal has been spotted where it looks like it has a horn on its back.
8035	飲み水として使おうと貯めておいた水に、角ツチブタが集団で水遊びをしてしまったせいで、大きな被害が出てしまいました。どうか[メイズ平原の巨大な花の模様と巨大な人の模様の中間付近]にいるあの角ツチブタを10匹退治してください。
8036	There's a rumor that the horn on the Horned Aardvark's back is a result of its skin changing over time, like fingernails. I wanted to look into it further, so could you get me five of their claws? The Horned Aardvarks are usually found near the [midpoint between the Giant Flower Mark and the Giant Human Mark in Maiz Prairie.]
8037	今までイリアで発見された背中に鬣(たてがみ)のあるブタなら<br/>鬣ツチブタと…あとは鬣カワイノシシくらいだね。<br/>でも、今の話だと鬣ツチブタに近いかもしれないな。<p/>最近会った冒険者の話によると<br/>メイズ平原の巨大な花の模様周辺の広範囲で鬣ツチブタを見かけたらしいよ。
8038	Are you aware of the fact that the Goddess of Wealth, Paiea, is also called the 'Shining Pig"? That being said, I am puzzled by all that anger from the pigs of Iria. Please eliminate 10 Maned Aardvarks [near the giant flower mark in Maiz Prairie]. They have been causing a lot of trouble with the explorers these days.
8039	‘輝くブタ’と呼ばれた富の女神 パエアは、<br/>実は、イウェカを意味する存在でもあるんだ。<br/>元々ブタは、富を象徴する動物でね…。<br/>現実では冒険者や近辺に住んでいる人たちを苦しめる<br/>凶暴なモンスターだけどね。<p/>鬣ツチブタは、メイズ平原の巨大な花の模様周辺に<br/>広範囲に点在しているよ。
8040	I need 5 claws of Maned Aardvark that can be found [spread out all around the giant flower mark in Maiz Prairie]. If you can get me those claws, I will reward you well for your effort.
8041	理由はよくわからないけど、最近に入って<br/>鬣ツチブタの爪を求めてる人が多いんだよね。<br/>わたしから直接鬣ツチブタの爪を渡すことはできないけど、<br/>ツチブタの生息地くらいは教えてやろう。<p/>鬣ツチブタは、キャンプの北東側、<br/>メイズ平原の巨大な花の模様周辺の広範囲で<br/>よく目撃されるらしいよ。
8042	Please defeat 10 Short Horn Gnus that can be found at a [prairie located at the midpoint of the camp and the giant flower mark].
8043	Have you ever given a deep thought to the meaning of the number 5? 5 is a microcosm of the big universe, and it represents human. Look up the sky and think of a pentagon-shaped star. Doesn't that remind you of a shape of a human? Don't ask why. Just get me 5 Short Horn Gnu Hooves at the [prairie right in between the camp and the giant flower mark]. It'd be nice if you can think of what I just told you as you pick up each hoof.
8044	Long Horn Gnus are generally very calm, but once they tick, they are some of the scariest creatures out there. With its sharp, thick horn, these gnus apply enough damage to the explorers that I see a number of them being rushed to the hospital here at the camp. I'd wish for the explorers to just leave them alone, but... there's at least one person out there who'd attack the gnus in hopes of obtaining their horns. To ensure that other travelers won't be in danger, please eliminate 10 Long Horn Gnus at the [prairie near the flower marking and beyond in Maiz Prairie].
8045	The gnus' hooves are big in size and solid in texture, so they are used for sculptures and accessories. The hooves of the Long Horn Gnu are considered the very best, but they are also really hard to get... I hear that finding Long Horn Gnus itself is very difficult. If you ever pass by a [prairie near the flower marking and beyond in Maiz Prairie], please find a way to obtain 5 Long Horn Gnu Hooves for me.
8046	Based on my research, Cactus Lizard is basically a cactus drawing the lizard in, and attach itself onto the back of the lizard. This also means when the lizard dies, the cactus will find another lizard to latch on to... to make sure this is true, I want you to find 10 Cactus Lizards [all around the central part of Muyu Desert] and eliminate them, then see if any change occurs.
8047	I am an ecologist studying the lives of desert animals. Cactus Lizards are known to obtain nutrients and moisture from cactus through its scales. If that is indeed true, then I think it's a monumental discovery that breaks the boundaries between animals and plants. If you ever find yourself in [central Muyu Desert], please get me 5 Cactus Lizard Scales that'll help me validate this theory.
8048	Is there a creature out there as vicious and cruel as Long Mane Hyenas? You can find them at a [corner that heads to Karu Forest in central Muyu Desert], and I want you to defeat 10 Long Mane Hyenas for me.
8049	I need 5 Long Mane Hyena Claws that you can find at the [corner that heads to Karu Forest in central Muyu Desert]. Whoever can get me those will be handsomely rewarded.
8050	There are some ruthless Hyenas out there who would wait until your weapon durability sinks, then ambush you when that happens. Unlike regular Hyenas, these Hyenas do not have any stripes on them. Even my friend got ambushed once, and he's been shaken up ever since. Go to the [corner in Muyu Desert that leads to either a prairie or a forest] to find some Stripeless Hyenas, and teach them a lesson for me, will you?
8051	Hyena Claws have long been linked to dark sorcery. they're said to be a charm which brings destruction. If you happen to pick up some Stripeless Hyena Claws at the [corner of Muyu Desert leading to a prairie or a forest], please bring them to me at once, for they might be dangerous to even carry
8052	What do you think about the hyenas? When someone is referred to as hyena-like, that would probably include all the negative meanings like greed, negativity, and indecisiveness. Please eliminate 10 Striped Hyenas that can be found [spread out all over central Muyu Desert].
8053	Some hyena claws are related to sorcery, but probably not for a good reason. Something like a charm that attracts disasters? If you pick up some Striped Hyena Claws that can be found [spread out all over central Muyu Desert], please bring them to me, for it may be dangerous to handle.
8054	Please slay 10 Short Mane Hyenas that keeps attacking innocent explorers at the [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest]. Your efforts will be rewarded.
8055	Are you aware of the putrid odor that emits from Short Mane Hyena? Those that had the unfortunate experience say it's similar to that of a rotten egg. It may be because of the rotten carcass stuck in the claws that they don't wash after a night of hunting. The interesting thing about this is that the same claw also contains ingredients that cure a devastating sickness. Please head to a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest] and gather up 5 Short Mane Hyenas.
8056	On the way back to the camp after a night of exploring, I was ambushed by a herd of Cactus Lizards in the desert and almost got buried six feet under. After a long struggle, I thought I had managed to escape the madness, when I got knocked out by a sneak attack by a Brown-legged Fennec Fox. Can anyone slay 10 of those foxes at [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Maiz Prairie, and nearby the coastline]?
8057	I am a fashion designer, famous for my work with fur coats and fur scarves. From what I hear, the foxes in Iria feature a very distinctive color on their fur, but they lack in softness and shine. Is that true? FI hear that Brown-legged Fennec Fox fur found [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Maiz Prairie, and nearby the coastline] are the most common and useful fur in the area.
8058	Black is the color of confusion and death. Just the thought of a black-legged fox creeps me out. Right now I have been busy singlehandedly trying to eliminate Black-legged Fennec Foxes around the area, but it's not enough. Can you please come help me? Go find a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest] and eliminate 10 Black-legged Fennec Foxes for me.
8059	I am a fashion designer, famous for my work with fur coats and fur scarves. I want to express myself through my works featuring Black-legged Fennec Fox fur. I just need 5 Black-legged Fennec Fox fur that can be found at a [corner in central Muyu Desert that leads to Karu Forest]...
8060	Everything passes in time. The beauty of sunrise does not sustain for more than a few hours, and neither does rain. The moment you accept your mortality is when you can truly move on and continue with your life. I know this is boring to you, but please eliminate 10 Gray-legged Fennec Foxes at [a path that crosses the south passage of Maiz Prairie and south passage of Karu Forest located south of Muyu Desert.]
8061	Gray Fennec Foxes are really tough to find in Uladh. That may be the main reason why any accessory made out of Gray Fennec Fox fur are sold at a premium. Can you head over to [a path that crosses the south passage of Maiz Prairie and south passage of Karu Forest located south of Muyu Desert] and get me 5 Gray Fennec Fox fur?
8062	On the way back to the camp after a night of exploring, I was ambushed by a herd of Cactus Lizards in the desert and almost got buried six feet under. After a long struggle, I thought I had managed to escape the madness, when I got knocked out by a sneak attack by a Red-legged Fennec Fox. Can anyone slay 10 of those foxes [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Kaypi Canyon, near the coastline?]
8063	I know of some people that are completely against the use of fur, and some of them go to the extremes of showing hatred towards those that deal with the said fur. I don't disagree with their stance, but alas, I deal with fur. "I am just a regular merchant who collects Red-Legged Fennec Fox's fur [near the valley that leads from Muyu Desert to Kaypi Canyon, and the nearby the coastline.]That's what a real life is.
8064	Don't you see how tired I look these days? That's because of the Blue-Legged Fennec Foxes that cry every night near the [giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], and I haven't gotten any rest for days. All because of those foxes. I want someone to go there and eliminate some of those foxes for me. Can you do that?
8065	Blue is the color of the Druids. Blue represents clouds and clear skies, as well as peace and stability. The color blue stands for something that cannot be contained. Like a clear blue sky, blue knows no limits. I hope you understand now why my request to have you gather up some Blue-legged Fennec Fox fur in the [giant mark of a four-legged animal in Muyu Desert] is not just for the materials
8066	Whenever I set foot outside the camp, I get hounded with Mongooses. When that happens, though, I just give them a faint smile, followed by a whirlwind of Windmill that would completely wipe them out... hehehe... if you ever see a herd of Gray-tailed Mongooses at a [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark], please teach them a lesson or two on how dangerous humans are.
8067	Yes, the Grey-tailed Mongoose can be found near the huge flower pattern to the north-east of here. Occasionally, people say they are cute, but because they are still a wild animal, they can still be a danger to people.
8068	You know that each Mongoose features a different color for their tails as opposed to their legs, right? They say that the evolution of Mongoose over the centuries have differentiated their color of the tail as opposed to the legs. I hear that those characteristics are affected by what they eat, and the place they live in, so I want you to gather up some Gray-tailed Mongoose fur from the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark] for me, so I can conduct a research on it.
8069	You can typically distinguish the species by the colour of their tails. The Grey-tailed Mongoose can be found at the [prairie located in between the camp and the giant flower mark].
8070	It sounds as though you're talking about a Black-tailed Mongoose. As you can probably tell, Black-tailed Mongooses are difficult to find. Recently, though, I've obtained information on where you can find some <p/> Black-tailed Mongooses can be found [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie].
8071	There's a number of superstitions that the explorers abide by. One of those is that they believe spotting a black animal during their journey is always a bad omen. If you spot a Black-tailed Mongoose at a spot [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie], please eliminate some of them for the sake of future explorers that'd cross that area.
8072	Black-tailed Mongooses that can be found [a little bit up north towards the Lutra River from the midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] are a great source of fur... to make brush heads. That's why people refer to Black-tailed Mongooses as a walking 5-star brush. If you find a way to gather up their fur, you can pretty much say you're halfway through creating the perfect brush.
8073	褐色尻尾マングースを調査してるんですか？<br/>マングースがヘビを捕まえ食べてしまうのは事実ですが、<br/>実際に見ると全然怖くありません。<br/>いろいろなマングースの中で、褐色尻尾マングースは一番おとなしいタイプだそうです。<p/>キャンプからさほど離れていない所で見かけることができます。
8074	Seriously... you won't find anyone in the world who'd be more traumatized about rats that me, but those creatures around the camp, Mongooses... them, I can't stand at all. Can you imagine a rat that's as big as a cow walking around the area? I need to gather up some Holy Water of Lymilark, and I'll have to shear some sheep [around the camp], but... I really wish I don't have to see those Brown-tailed Mongooses.
8075	Have you seen a Mongoose? Unlike its rather gentile appearance, it is powerful enough to defeat a venomous snake in a blink of an eye. That's what led the explorers to believe that an armor covered on Mongoose fur would protect them from unforeseen danger. Go [not far from the camp, left or right] and gather up some Brown-tailed Mongoose fur for me, okay?
8076	I heard that there are Blue-tailed Mongoose at Maiz Prairie. They can be found [midway between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie].
8077	I have been gathering up a lot of information on Mongoose lately. It's fast and quick enough to handily capture snakes, but that's not enough to pinpoint their hunting tendencies just yet. If possible, I'd like for you to battle a Blue-tailed Mongoose yourself at a [midpoint between a giant flower mark and a giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] and let me know how they really fight in combat situation.
8078	I've been gathering up Mongoose fur in different colors to make accessories. It's not really for me, though. It's for a friend of mine who's going to explore the world for the first time. I realized that out of all the Mongoose fur, I think the Blue-tailed Mongoose fur that you can find at a [midpoint between the giant flower mark and the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie] makes me feel calm whenever I look at them. It must be the color...
8079	Have you heard of a rumor that when you wipe out all the White-tailed Mongooses that can be found [around the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie, and just a bit beyond that], the sky will turn black, and a monster that's decked out in gold armor will descend upon this place. I thought it wasn't worth paying attention to at first, but... over time, that's what really makes me want to try it once, just to see if it is true or not. Aren't you curious? Do you want to help me do this?
8080	... If you defeat all the White-tailed Mongooses, the sky will turn black, and a monster wearing golden armour will call down thunder from the sky? You... don't believe this rumor, do you? If you did, I'd be rather disappointed in you. <p/>  Anyways, you can find the White-tailed Mongoose [around the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie, and just a bit beyond that].
8081	There's a growing belief among the younger dating explorers in Iria that the White-tailed Mongoose fur helps protect the love they have for one another. There's even a saying that Mongoose used to represent luck and safety, and it evolved over time to becoming a symbol of protection of love. That's why we have been running out of White-tailed Mongoose fur that are primarily from [the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie and beyond].
8082	The rumors that the White-tailed Mongoose's fur bestows good luck are still about, and it seems that it has also become fashionable, so we've been running out of fur. You can find White-tailed Mongooses at [the giant human mark in Maiz Prairie and beyond].
8083	I got information that there is a hidden ruin between the valley in the south-western part of the Muyu Desert, and Karu Forest. However, I can't concentrate on my work due to the white kiwi wandering around...  Can you kill the kiwis around there, please?
8084	It seems the demand for Kiwi Feathers increased, especially for those who visited Iria. There was an interesting rumor that Kiwi Feathers are lucky like Four-Leafed Clovers. So, why don't you bring me 5 White Kiwi Feathers? You can them between the south-western part of the Muyu Desert, and Karu Forest.
8085	The White-eared Bush Boars that you find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] may look docile and adorable, but when they are in an attack mode, they can be ruthless. Once they start charging towards a human being, they won't stop until the person is completely knocked out, so a lot of explorers get hurt in the process. If you're stuck in a forest covered with tall trees, it's near impossible to avoid their attacks.
8086	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the White-eared Bush Boars you'll find [near the Mana Tunnel in Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8087	Just like regular boars, Bush Boars also dig up the ground in search of food. Every so often, they create huge puddles that horses trip over. Please head [a little south of the central Karu Forest] and please eliminate the suddenly-increasing number of Maned Bush Boars.
8088	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Maned Bush Boars you'll find [a little south of the central Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8089	Whenever I cross Karu Forest in search of artifacts, I spend too much time fighting the Big-eared Bush Boars. I really do not have the time to fight them all by myself, so if anyone can eliminate 10 Big-eared Bush Boars at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that], I will reward you for your work.
8090	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Black-eared Bush Boars you'll find [southern region of Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8091	Black-eared Bush Boars love to roll around mud and tree leaves, and their stench is unmistakable. Not only do they carry around that foul smell of theirs, but they also carry some nasty diseases that we may be vulnerable against. Please eliminate these Black-eared Bush Boars at the [southern region of Karu Forest].
8092	When you think of a boar's fur, you'd imagine it'd be rough and short, but the Black-eared Bush Boars you'll find [southern region of Karu Forest] have long, soft fur. Not only that, but they are reportedly light and feature a number of different colors, so their fur also seems to be a good crafting item for explorer's accessories.
8093	Lately the number of Green Forest Lizards have skyrocketed in an area [a little south of the central Karu Forest], threatening Iria's ecosystem. Nature requires balance as much as humans do, and if things like this happens, the humans may have to do something about it.
8094	People from old days believed that lizards belonged in Eweca, an incarnation of water. They also believed that it didn't have tongue and drank dew dropped in between rocks. Green Forest Lizards, found [a little south of the central Karu Forest], are believed to have frost-like element in their scales from the dew being frozen inside, and people that believe in it seem to look for their scales as a result.
8095	People who are getting fed up with the damage Black Forest Lizards cause have decided to take matters into their own hands and started a movement towards the complete destruction of them. Can you please supplement their efforts and eliminate Black Forest Lizards [a little south of the Central Karu Forest]? It's the culmination of small efforts like this that will eventually make Iria a better place to live.
8096	I have collected the scales of Black Forest Lizard, White Forest Lizard, Brown Forest Lizard, and Gold Forest Lizard. I am missing the one of a Black Forest Lizard. The problem is, I am in an emergency situation right now and I'll have to leave Iria for a bit, and so I'll need someone else's help in acquiring a Black Forest Lizard scale, most likely found [a little south of the central Karu Forest].
8097	I believe the way I judge people is very real. I just judge people based on what I see with my own eyes. That's the most important thing. If you can head to the [center of Karu Forest, and a bit north of that] and eliminate 10 White Forest Lizards, then I will be respecting you to the amount of someone that defeated 10 lizards.
8098	I hear that the demand for lizard scales have skyrocketed these days. I have no idea exactly where they are going to be used, but that doesn't matter. I'm a business person, and wherever there's a demand, I'll be carrying them with me. That's why... can you do me a favor and go to the [center of Karu Forest, and a bit north of that] and gather up 5 White Forest Lizard scales for me?
8099	Have you heard about the curse of Brown Forest Lizard found at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that]? They say that if you're a victim of the Lizard's Curse, then your soul will be tied to the Brown Forest Lizard. Unfortunately... I think I am suffering from the said curse myself. Lately I have been feeling strange at my self...please help me break from this devastating curse.
8100	There are some shady people that would repackage the Brown Forest Lizard scales as Dragon scales and charge premium for them, causing a huge outrage in the Uladh market place. How can people not tell the difference between dragon scales and lizard scales? Now that I hear this... I am curious to see what the Brown Forest Lizard scales may look like. You'll find them at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that], too.
8101	The reason why the bears are considered brutal is because they eat everything. With a wide, flat set of molars and strong jaw bone, it can eat insects, animals, honey, fruit, whatever. That got me thinking... don't you think we're quite similar to them as well? Anyway, please head over to the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that] and eliminate these brutal Manchurian White Bears.
8102	A friend from back home wrote me a letter saying he's worried about the incoming winter, because he really can't stand cold. I was thinking of a unique gift for him, and I came up with an idea. How about a muffler made out of Manchurian White Bear fur found at the [center of Karu Forest, and a little north of that]? Can you help me get it for me?
8103	Manchurian Black Bears [nearby the giant tree mark, and a little south of the central Karu Forest] have completely wiped out the berries in nearby regions, and it's getting to the point where we may never be able to re-grow them. I have been gaining weight lately, so I need a lot of those anyway to lose weight, but this is not good at all.
8104	I'll need to come up with some gifts for the folks back home before I go back soon, and I guess I'll have to give them some authentic Iria products, right? I kept wondering what kind of a present my family would want, and decided that Manchurian Black Bear fur that can be found [around the giant tree mark, and a little south of the central Karu Forest] would be perfect. If I knot them up and make a key chain out of it, then I think the folks will really like it.
8105	Whenever I see those long-legged spiders crawling around, they give me the biggest creeps. At least the Cactus Lizards are cute, you know... whenever I cross the desert, I'd run into a White-spot Desert Spider [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], and that would scare me like nothing else. Can somebody please eliminate these White-spot Desert Spiders for me?
8106	Desert spiders are very venomous, so you must be careful at all times. There's a lot of people lately that have been bit by these venomous spiders, so I have been gathering up venom sacs of different spiders to study and create the ultimate antidote. To help facilitate this process, can you please head over to a spot [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert] and find some White-spot Desert Spider venom sacs for me?
8107	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White-striped Desert Spiders leave.
8108	I process the venom sac of a spider to make a tight, light gold sack. It's very elastic, so it stores a lot more gold than sacks made out of cow skin or horse skin. I'm thinking of making a wallet or a mask out of it down the road. If you happen to acquire some White-striped Desert Spider venom sacs [near the giant four-legged animal mark in Muyu Desert], please send them to me.
8109	My life revolves around introducing the explorers of Iria to a world of searching for artifacts and ruins sites. It always feels good seeing them make major strides towards becoming bonafide explorers, you know. But whenever I look for artifacts towards a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert], I see a number of explorers losing focus by busily picking up the cobwebs the White Desert Spiders leave
8110	The spider found at a spot [southwest of central Muyu Desert] does have a venom sac, but since it does not have a venomous bite, the venom is obviously not used. I feel that if I study a Venom Sac from a White Desert Spider, then I might be able to finally find a connection between Venom Sacs and web sacs.
8111	Hey there! Are you aware that Black Desert Spiders carry venom so unbelievably potent that it's plain shocking? They are so potent that a teaspoon full of it can wipe out Dunbarton in an instant. When I went to [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert], I see these Black Desert Spiders roaming around recklessly.
8112	I know this sounds crazy, but I plan on acquiring some Black Desert Spider venom sacs at [a region a little bit west of central Muyu Desert] and pour them into a lake. Don't look at me like that. There's a reason for it. Apparently, one of the components of the spider venom can actually purify water, among other things.
8113	Spiders don't offer too much threat to the explorers, but the explorers do run into some tight situations when running into a sticky cobweb in between the trees in a forest. For the sake of other explorers, I want you to eliminate 10 Brown Forest Mushroom Spiders [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]
8114	When you slay those spiders in Iria, you'll acquire a venom sac from time to time. The venom from Forest Mushroom Spider is actually used to create an antidote potion. Lately I have been working on creating one of my own, so I have been gathering up Brown Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest]. Please gather up those venom sacs for me, and be careful of their sharp teeth and claws.
8115	The region [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] is so destitute and dried out because of the venom Red Forest Mushroom Spiders drip from time to time. Their venom is so potent that they have collectively destroyed the land in that area.
8116	The Red Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs that can be found [around the giant snake mark in Karu Forest] are coveted more for the sac itself, as opposed to the venom inside. Since it's a sac that holds that potent venom, the durability must be outstanding to say the least.
8117	It hasn't been long since I started studying the Blue Forest Mushroom Spiders found at [the region north of the giant snake mark and the region south of giant tree mark in Karu Forest]. At first, I thought they were just giant mutant spiders, but the more I studied them, the more I found out about these creatures. I have also realized that they are a legitimate threat to mankind here.
8118	Are you attracted to venoms? I know this is a bit random, but I do need some Blue Forest Mushroom Spider venom sacs at [the region north of the giant snake mark and the region south of giant tree mark in Karu Forest]. Am I attracted to venoms? Maybe...
8119	Do you know why we humans are more superior to animals? That's because only humans can create and establish their own world. Do not hesitate to eliminate some animals in Iria. Head over to a region [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] and eliminate those Black Forest Mushroom Spiders that keep standing in the explorers' ways, and make this place a better place to live for us all!
8120	You know how the opposites attract? The venom sac from Black Forest Mushroom Spiders found [around the giant tree mark in Karu Forest] may contain potentially lethal poison, but the same poison can be used as an ingredient for a potion.
8121	[ムユ砂漠とカルー森間の渓谷に隠された所]を知っているか？隠された遺跡があるという情報を手に入れ、その近くを重点的に探索しているんだが、うろちょろしている白キウイのせいで、作業に集中できない。手伝える人がいたら、ここにいるキウイどもを退治してくれないか？
8122	イリアに行ってきた人を中心に、キウイの羽根を欲しがる人が増えたそうだ。巷にはキウイの羽根が四葉のクローバーと同じ幸運を運んでくれるという面白い話もある。そこでなんだが、[ムユ砂漠とカルー森間の渓谷に隠された所]にいる白キウイの羽根を5個だけ持ってきてくれ。
8123	Defeat 10 Masked Goblins

8126	Some of those masked Goblins even carry a bow with them. Some of the explorers that have not been used to combating against enemies with bows are having trouble inside [Karu Forest Ruins]. Please eliminate them whenever you see one.
8127	Defeat 10 Pot-Belly Spiders
8128	I hear that at [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a spider wearing a pot over its head. Those spiders are notorious for not letting go once they get a clean bite, so a lot of the explorers seem to be having trouble with them.

8133	Eliminate 10 Stone Bisons
8134	A moving stone sculpture that strongly resembles a cow, Stone Bison, is supposedly found at [Karu Forest Ruins]. They have a nasty streak that threatens the very safety of the explorers that visit the site, so I'm looking for someone brave enough to eliminate them for us.
8135	Eliminate 10 Stone Imps

8144	I hear that around [Karu Forest Ruins], a ghost wearing a gold mask can be found from time to time. Please eliminate these pesky gold-masked ghosts that would just never let the passing explorers go.

8146	People have been telling me they have seen a Skeleton with a huge jaw at [Karu Forest Ruins]. These Skeletons are known for floating around waiting for someone to pass by, then attack them for no reason. Please eliminate these Skeleton Ghosts.
8147	Eliminate 10 Powerful Pot-Belly Spiders
8148	When you enter [a particular site of ruins in Karu Forest], you'll run into a Pot-Belly Spider that's even more powerful than most. They may look like a regular Pot-Belly Spider, but they are actually much tougher to defeat, so a lot of explorers seem to have trouble with them.

8157	Eliminate 1 Glowing Pot-Belly Spider
8158	I've heard that people who have been to the deepest parts of [Karu Forest Ruins] have witnessed there a Glowing Pot-Belly Spider. There's nothing more shocking to explorers than the sight of light from the middle of nowhere, and the light's origin is a mystery.
8159	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Hound
8160	At [Karu Forest Ruins], there's a Stone Hound there that glows unlike others. No one knows exactly what it is, and since no one knows about it, it poses as a serious threat to explorers that visit the ruins.

8164	Glowing Stone Zombies are the most mysterious creatures you can ever find. No one knows anything about it, and so many people have visited the [Karu Forest Ruins] in hopes of figuring out the mysterious glow it produces. Most of them wound up never coming back out of the ruins.
8165	Eliminate 1 Glowing Stone Imp

8573	隠された遺跡を見つけるなら、必ずＬロッドの力を借りないとね。<br/>まだＬロッドがないなら、<br/>わたしが売っているＬロッドをひとつ購入して。<br/>探検家なら必ず必要なアイテムだからね。<p/><image name='npctalk_l_rod' width='200' height='200' />Ｌロッドは遺物を隠している<br/>魔法の力に反応する鉱石を利用して作った特別な道具みたい。<p/><image  local='true' name='npctalk_searching_ruins' width='625' height='200' />この道具を持って歩くと、<br/>隠されている遺物が近くにある場合、それに反応して光と音を放つんだ。<br/>そして近づくほどに大きく反応する。<p/><image  local='true' name='npctalk_searching_ruins' width='625' height='200' />Ｌロッドを持って移動しながら、<br/>光と共にコンという音が4回鳴るところで<br/>Xキーを押して、Ｌロッドを使うと<br/>Ｌロッドの魔力で遺物を隠してる魔法を解除することができるよ。<p/>それじゃ、 Ｌロッドを両手に持って、キャンプを出てから、<br/>魔法で隠された鳥の石像の柱を探してみて。<p/>鳥の石像の柱は、キャンプの前から花模様の平原の中央まで<br/>ずっと並んでるから。
8574	ひょっとして鳥の石像の柱を探しに遠くまで行っちゃったかしら？<br/>用事で遠くに行くのは目的があるからいいけど、<br/>戻ってくる道のりは退屈なものよね。<p/>そんなとき、素早く戻って来られるアイテムがあるの。<br/>女神の翼というんだけど、これ、<username/>さんにひとつプレゼントするわね。<p/>今受け取った女神の翼の上にカーソルをあわせると、<br/>以前訪問した場所が目的地として表示されるはずよ。<br/>その場所を右クリックをして「使用する」を選択すれば、目的地に移動できるの。<br/>パーティーのリーダーが使えば、近くにいるパーティーメンバーも一緒に移動できるわよ。<p/>イリアの女神の翼で移動できる場所は、<br/>ケルラベースキャンプか、最後に通った巨大な模様の上などよ。<p/>もし最後に通った場所が巨大な花の模様だったら<br/>女神の翼を使って行ける所は巨大な花の模様のところになるの。<br/>キャンプに戻って来たい場合は、キャンプを出てから巨大な模様を踏まないようにすれば<br/>いつでもここにもどってこれるってわけ。<p/>女神の翼は、わたしの隣にいるヒルブリンが売ってるわ。<br/>「取引」ボタンを押して「魔法アイテム」タブの中から選んでね。<p/>探検家を目指す<username/>さんに<br/>この情報がちょっとでも役立てば嬉しいわ。<br/>慌てないでいろんなことを少しずつ覚えていってね。
8575	彫刻された柱はそんなに珍しくないのよ。<br/>砂漠や平原に沢山あるから簡単に見つけられるわ。<p/>でも、石柱の中には特徴的な物もあって<br/>立っている姿と模様が他のとは違う物もあるの。<br/><username/>が探すべきものは<br/>柱に雲と雨が彫られた物。<p/>このキャンプを出たらカイピ峡谷にそって進みながら<br/>周囲をよく見てみなさい。<p/>かなり古い柱なので<br/>壊れて小さいから見逃さないように。<p/><show_dir pos='190515 205592' pitch='15'/>説明だけじゃ解りにくいだろうから<br/>わたしが柱の方向を教えてあげる。<p/>矢印の方向に向かって進めば<br/>簡単に見つけられるはずよ。
8576	花畑と鳥が彫られた柱とは…<br/>いったいどんな探検家が探し出すのか…。<br/>その柱は、ベースキャンプと巨大な花の模様の<br/>中間にあります。<p/>ベースキャンプと巨大な花の模様の間に<br/>ヌベス山脈がそびえている所があって、<br/>その山脈の東にあります。<p/>花畑と鳥が彫られた柱は、<br/>5層構造の曲がった柱なので<br/>すぐ目につくと思います。<p/>イリアには不思議なものが多いですが、<br/>その意味についてはまだよく知られていません。<br/>その柱の意味は一体…<p/><show_dir pos='190150 241880' pitch='15'/>説明だけ聞いても探すのが大変でしょうから、<br/>私が方向を教えてあげましょう。<br/><username/>さんが今見ている方向に向かって<br/>画面上に進んでください。
8577	最近妙に柱に興味を持つ人が多いけど<br/>そんなに魅力的な物なのかしら。<p/>人と花畑の模様が彫られた柱は知っているけど<br/>ここから少し離れたところにあるのよ。<p/>ムユ砂漠まで行ったことがあるのなら話は早いんだけど、<br/>カイピ峡谷を沿って進むと、ムユ砂漠に行く道があるのは知ってる？<p/>その道を入らずに北へ進むと<br/>お目当ての柱が見えるはず。<p/>崩れた2層の柱だから<br/>見逃さないようにするのよ。<p/><show_dir pos='232585 269953' pitch='15'/>説明だけじゃ解りにくいだろうから<br/>わたしが柱の方向を教えてあげる。<p/>矢印の方向に向かって進めば<br/>簡単に見つけられるはずよ。
8578	人、鳥、花畑の絵が彫られている柱は<br/>少し見つけにくいと思うの。<p/>ここから遠いのも理由なんだけど<br/>目印になるような物が何もないのよ。<p/>巨大な花の模様と巨大な人の模様の中間地点から<br/>北に少し進むと、木々の間に探している柱があります。<br/>恐らく黒尻尾マングースがたくさんいるところにあると思いますが…<p/>この柱は、上の部分が崩れた4層の柱だからすぐ見つかるはずです。<br/><username/>さんにあまり詳しい説明ができなくて残念だけど<br/>うまくいくように祈ってるわ。
8579	独特な模様に興味を持ってる人が多くてさ～、<br/>柱と模様について研究する学者も結構多いみたいね。<p/>今度探す柱は、メイズ平原の一番北東にあるよ。<br/>巨大な人の模様から東に進むとところどころに木が見えはじめるんだけど、<br/>もう少し進むと雲、雨、鳥が描かれた柱を意外と簡単に探せるはず。<p/>上の部分が崩れた3層の柱だから、<br/>通り過ぎないように注意してね。<p/>すごく遠くて難しそうだって？<br/>探検家ならこの程度は克服しなくちゃね。
8580	雲、雨、鳥が描かれた柱は…<br/>その柱なら、ムユ砂漠の入口にあるモノだね。<br/>この柱は、5層構造だけど倒れてる。<p/>メイズ平原からムユ砂漠に向かう谷間を越え、<br/>カイピ渓谷に沿って南のマナトンネルに向かって行くと<br/>中間地点で見つかると思うよ。<p/>赤土と砂砂漠の間にあるんだけど、<br/>片方は人間の顔だけ見えて、もう片方は太陽の顔だけみえるらしい。<br/>片方だけみて通り過ぎないように注意して。<p/>砂漠は平原と違って、人間を攻撃する動物が多いから<br/>常に周囲に気を配ってね。
8581	わたしが調べてみたところ、砂漠の柱には<br/>共通する太陽の模様があるんだ。<br/>これから探すべき柱もその中の一つだけど…。<p/>ムユ砂漠のど真ん中にあって、<br/>冒険者がみんなして探し難いって不満を言うんだよね。<br/>砂丘の低い部分にあるから、<br/>高いところからよく探さないと見つからないかも。<p/>各層が互い違いの向きをしているから<br/>分かるはずよ。<p/>ムユ砂漠の中央を旅する時には、<br/>砂丘に隠れてる凶暴な動物たちに気をつけてね。
8582	ヘビが彫られた柱のこと？<br/>それってムユ砂漠から遠く離れてるあの柱を言ってるのかな？<p/>ヘビと太陽、雲と雨が彫られた<br/>4層構造の柱なら、砂漠の北側に一つあるね。<br/>今まで発見された柱の中で<br/>ヘビの模様は、それ一つしかないからね。<p/>ヘビが彫られた柱は、ムユ砂漠の北側から<br/>巨大な４本足の動物の模様から遠く離れていない場所にあるよ。<br/>巨大な４本足の動物の模様のお尻と尻尾の部分から出発して<br/>少し南に行って初めて見える柱さ。
8583	ムユ砂漠を越えて行くと木が茂るカルー森に出るよ。<br/>冒険者なら、わかると思うけど、<br/>森の中にある隠された遺跡を探すのに大変だろうね～？<p/>森の中を移動する時には不便さだけじゃなくて、<br/>ツキノワグマのような凶暴な動物に襲われても<br/>木に引っかかって逃げにくい時が多いと思うよ。<p/>あ、あと、探している木の模様の柱は、森の北側にあるんだ。<br/>カルー森北のマナトンネルから少し東に行ってから<br/>南に下っていくと見つからしい。<p/>その柱は、倒れてるし、<br/>森の木に隠れて探しにくいんだよね。<p/>白ツキノワグマと黒耳カワイノシシらが<br/>柱周辺をうろうろしてるから気をつけたほうがいいぞ。
8584	巨大鳥の伝説の本読みました？<br/>鳥が閉じ込められた壁に関する内容は本当みたいだけど…<br/>この伝説の出処っていうか…？<br/>巨大鳥について話す住民たちの説明が全然ないんですよね。<p/>砂漠南に巨大鳥の模様があるらしいです。<br/>普通、巨大な模様の近くには、石像があるといわれています。<br/>遺跡を調査して、巨大鳥の伝説と<br/>関連ある内容があるか調査してくれませんか？<p/>巨大鳥の模様の位置は…砂漠北部の3体の石像を知ってますか？<br/>その中で頭が鳥のくちばしみたいに鋭い石像が見つめる方向へ向かえば<br/>壁に閉じ込められた鳥を見付けることができて、それを通りすぎて<br/>砂漠の終わりの海近くまで行くと見つかるそうです。<p/>砂漠南の巨大鳥の模様に行って、<br/>巨大鳥の伝説と関連する遺跡があるか探してください。
8585	スケッチした絵は、剣を持っている石像…<br/>戦士の石像と呼ばれているものだね。<br/>巨大鳥を倒す戦士という解釈は可能かもしれないけど、<br/>具体的な証拠なく、推測だけで本の内容に合わせてしまうのはよくない。<p/>それ以外に本の内容を証明する資料は何もないようだ。<br/>夜になると光る遺跡は、実際に確認されたけど<br/>それ以外に追加で確認された戦士の石像では<br/>巨大鳥が復活したという伝説の内容まで本当だとするのはちょっと難しいね。<p/>遠いところまで自分の代わりに調査してくれて<br/>本当にありがとう。
8586	古代のイリア人の神の使者 - ヘビという本、<br/>読んだことあるかい？<br/>その本によると古代のイリア人は、<br/>ヘビを神の使者だと信じてヘビの神殿を建てたらしいね。<p/>本の作者は、カルー森南のどこかに<br/>地上に描かれたヘビの絵と<br/>その周りの神殿の遺跡があると書いているんだ。<br/>その神殿と関連したものがあるか調べてみてくれるかい？<p/>実は、今までイリアで<br/>神殿を見たという話を聞いたことがなくて…。<br/>わたしはその本の内容の半分も信用してないよ。<p/><username/>さんが調べてくれれば、<br/>その話が本当か、<br/>もしくは、絵空事か明らかになるだろう。<p/>砂漠の3体の石像から石像が向いている南の方に進めば、<br/>地面に巨大なヘビの模様が現れるだろう。<br/>その近くの石像とその周りの神殿の痕跡を探してほしい。
8587	地面の巨大なヘビの模様と新しい石像を発見しましたね。<br/>見たことがない戦士の石像なんですが…<br/>この石像は本で言及されてないために、<br/>ヘビ神殿の伝説の内容とは特に関連はなさそうですね。<p/>でもヘビが刻まれた壁の遺跡は、本の内容とかなり異なりますね。<br/>スケッチしてくれた絵を見ると、小さな壁の一部なのに、<br/>これをあたかも神殿のように書いて、古代イリアの人たちの<br/>神まで想像してしまうとは…<p/>ときどき存在しない遺跡を発見したり、<br/>発見した遺跡について拡大解釈する探検家もいるそうです。<br/>イリア開拓と探検において、一番難しい部分のひとつです。<br/>これらが探検と伝説について、すべての話を信じられない理由です。<p/>そのため私が<username/>さんに<br/>よく調査をお願いするんです。<br/>どういう意味かわかりますよね？<p/><username/>さんも、多くのものを<br/>自分の目で見て記録してください。<br/>それが探検家の一番重要な点ですから。<p/>正確な情報をありがとうございました。<br/>それではまた次回もお願いします。

8589	お～本当に最後の石像を調べてきたね。<br/>かなり時間がかかると思って、ゆっくり待ってたんだよ。<p/>ほかの冒険者がすぐ足を踏み入れられない探検でも<br/><username/>さんは簡単にやっちゃうね！<br/>探検のセンスがあるんじゃないかな？<p/>スケッチしてくれた石像は、手を後ろに組んだ偉人の石像だね。<br/>これで私が集めている石像に関する資料は全部集まったな。<br/>探検家たちの努力を無駄にしないために<br/>それを分析する人も必要なんだ。<p/>イリア大陸に立っている石像の正体とその意味を明かすには、<br/>まだまだ時間がかかると思うけど、<br/><username/>さんと一緒なら、<br/>楽しく続けられそうな気がするよ。<p/>もし新しい情報を得られたら、すぐわたしに知らせてちょうだいね。<br/>楽しみに待ってるよ。

8899	Ｌロッドを持って砂漠を歩き回っていると、<br/>隠されている遺跡にＬロッドが反応します。<p/>一般的に魔法で隠された平地の遺跡は、<br/>どのＬロッドを使っても見つけられます。<p/>しかし、砂の奥深くに埋まっているいくつかの遺跡は<br/>冷たい風のＬロッドを使って<br/>砂を取り除かないと見つけられません。<p/>たまに砂を深く掘っていると、<br/>とてつもない地下迷路に落ちることもあるので<br/>気をつけてくださいね。<p/>探検クエストと関連した話はこれで全てです。<br/>あとは<username/>さんがこれをうまく活用するだけですね。

10187	At the foot of the hill below the village of Philia, a dungeon of desert ruins is hidden. Why don't you experience the dungeon soon? Clear the dungeon of the ruins in the Longa Desert! Why don't you try it? \ n --Meles-

10189	Clear a Longa Desert Ruins Dungeon
10190	Speak with Meles
10191	Unlike fighting out in the fields, when you fight in a dungeon, you're in a small space against multiple enemies. You should adjust your strategies accordingly. <p/> While it's not difficult to overcome a dungeon, you may want to have other people join you in clearing the dungeon. <p/><image name='npctalk_connous_ruin_entrance' width='180' height='180'/> The Longa Desert Dungeon is under Filia, but you usually have to find it using an L-rod. However, once you find it, it will be marked on your map, making it much easier to visit again. <p/> Once you have found the entrance, enter it and drop an item on the momunment, anything you want, and you will enter the dungeon. <p/> The boss may be a bit difficult, but... Well, I expect you will be fine. Good luck!
10192	Oh? You've cleared the dungeon? I suppose this dungeon is too easy for you... <p/> Oh, that's right. If you drop the arrow that the dungeon's boss drops, you can enter a special dungeon, which has stronger enemies. <p/> At your current level, though, it may be a little bit too difficult. Why don't you, when you get more experience and become stronger, try to clear it? <p/> Anyways, good work clearing the dungeon.
10193	Sketch Longa's Lighthouse
10194	When you head south of the Mana Tunnel of Filia, you'll find a tall pillar that is supporting a round dish on top.

10413	Oh, I've come often.<br/>You will learn a lot while spending time here,<br/>When I'm on an adventure, I'll eventually go to a dungeon.<p/>If you can challenge the dungeon,<br/>You can say that he is a good explorer.<br/>But of course you're just here<br/>I wonder if it can't be done right away.<p/>So when you grow up, give you a dungeon pass<br/>Let's talk to other people.<br/>When it's time to try it yourself, ask the villagers.<p/>That's it. Beginners who have just visited here now<br/>It's a special period to help as much as possible.<br/>So some of the long-time people who have come here<br/>Some people will help you.<p/>If you meet such a person, learn a lot and<br/>Form a party and act together.<br/>If you give a beginner title and wear a chick hat<br/>You should be aware of it.
10414	How was the Albi Beginner Event Dungeon?<br/>It was hard work. Cheeks ...<br/>You are already a great adventurer.<p/>Someday you will leave here like Dunbarton or Van Hool<br/>It will be time to go to another village.<br/>So that you can explore other dungeons there as well<br/>I have already talked about it.<p/>Talk to Evan in Dunbarton's office first.<br/>Will tell you a detailed story.<br/>Ah ... but that doesn't mean you should go right now, right?<br/>I'll still have something to learn here.<p/>Where I left what I could learn here<br/>You won't get a pass from Evan.<br/>Well, don't rush. When the time comes<br/>It will go on naturally. Cheeks ...
10415	<username/>Mr. Miss,<br/>How was the mass beginner event dungeon?<br/>Best of all, I was able to return safely.<username/>I believed that it would be easy to clear.<p/>This time it's going down all the way south from Dunbarton<br/>You will challenge the Bali dungeon of Van Hool.<br/>Of course, it's not right now.<br/>It's enough even after finishing the errands here in Dunbarton.<p/>Just like when I came here, when the time comes<br/>You will naturally go to Van Hool.<p/>In Van Hool, Priest Kamgan should give you a pass, so<br/>Listen carefully to Priest Kamgan's explanation<br/>It would be nice if you could challenge the dungeon accordingly.
10416	Did you go safely without getting hurt?<username/>Thanks to Mr., we were also very helpful.<br/>Beginner event dungeons are compared to other dungeons<br/>I'm still safe, so I don't think it was that difficult.<p/>This is given by Duncan, the mayor of Tilconail.<br/>You've finished all the exploration quests.<br/>You will receive a reward once you complete the quest.<br/>Please continue to come to Van Hool from time to time to help us.

If the L-Rod loudly beeps four times, that means you are close to the site of ruins. That's when you press 'X' and click on the ground where you feel the site of ruins is located.

11205	Throwing Attack
11206	You should know from experience that close-combat isn't everything in battles. You need to know how to attack an enemy from a distance to have a balanced attack. We don't use silly toys like the bows that elves use. I'll teach you about how to throw a spear - Krug

11218	うまく描いてきたな。<br/>だが、イリア大陸の遺跡には、<br/>魔法で隠されていてＬロッドで探さねばならないものも多い。 <br/>もし発見したとしても、スケッチする前に消えてしまうものもある。<p/>お前にもそのうち、Ｌロッドを利用して隠された遺跡を探す仕事を任せる。 <br/>今のピシスには強い戦士だけでなく、有能な探検家も必要なのだ。

11222	Use the Counterattack skill against a Young Brown Dingo 1 time
11223	Report to Taunes
11224	You seem to be getting used to fighting too.<br/>However, from now on, the opponent's enemies will become stronger.<br/>Before that, I'd like to teach you this skill.<p/>The counter attack skill is a skill that uses the power of the opponent's melee attack to deal damage.<br/>When you use the skill, you will be in a position to stop there and wait for the enemy's attack.<br/>At this time, if the enemy makes a melee attack,<br/>You can use that power to repeat the attack.<p/>However, if you receive a bow or magic attack while waiting for your opponent's melee attack,<br/>He will be damaged as it is.<br/>So it's a good idea to carefully observe the skills your opponent uses.<br/>Would you like to try hunting?
11225	The main weapon of the elf race is the bow.<br/>His counterattack does not work against the elf's bow attack.<br/>It may be more advantageous to use a stomp or spear.<p/>Anyway, use the skills that are suitable for the situation.<br/>What is suitable depends on the skill used by the opponent.<br/>Everything is an experience.<br/>Through that experience, a sense of combat is cultivated.

12383	Have you ever heard about the [Courcle's Heart]? I found a clue about it, do you want to hear it? - Voight
12384	Speak with Voight
12385	It was just a while ago. A stranger--wrapped in a thick, long robe--came to Cor. Imagine wearing a thick robe in this hot weather. At that time, we were even having the tropical nights phenomenon.  That's how I knew he was weird.<p/>As far as bizarreness goes, his artifact was worse. It was severely damaged, and I was barely able to restore it. The restored artifact looked particularly strange. <p/> It seemed to be a fragment of a relic, and every time I would apply a different chemical to it, new information would be discovered as if I were peeling the layers of an onion.<p/>Then I thought it might be the ’Heart of Courcle’, something that's recently been getting a lot of attention.<p/>I don’t know anything about that man: his name, where he lives, or why he wanted to restore the artifact.<p/>I didn’t even see his face because it was shrouded by the hood of his robe.<p/>Still, no one can hide from my sharp eyes, you know? Judging by the way he walked and moved, I think he’s an Elf. It’s fishy, you know? Out of curiosity, I borrowed Waboka's horse, though I didn't let him know about it, to go to Filia beyond the Longa Desert. Guess what I found after riding the horse in the sandy wind of the desert? "... ...Well, I’m sorry, but I’ve never heard of it before..." That’s what all the Elves told me. Every single one of them said exactly the same thing.<p/>Umm... Argh, this is getting more suspicious. I don’t believe them at all when they say that they’ve never heard of the Heart of Courcle. I mean, think about it.<p/>Every single adventurer in Iria is desperately looking for that heart, yelling the “Heart of Courcle” everywhere they go.<p/>I don’t know, but something strange is happening in Iria.

12440	You seem to be pretty interested in music! Gather in from of the bonfire, and sit down, and listen to someone playing music while drinking  cut of sake...! Well, anyways, continue to practice. If you reach [Rank D Playing Instrument], then I will give you a book that might be useful for music - Wanst
12441	It sounds like you're doing your best to learn how to play an instrument. I also have to keep my promises. Here is the book I promised you. <p/> The book was written by humans, so it's hard to get here. Although it is regrettable as a giant, humans are more likely to be good at music. That book should be useful.
12442	My name is 'Loeiz', the author of 'Erinn Music's History' volumes 1 and 2. I'm surprised to find out that my book is being read far across the ocean, even in the Giant village. It would be extremely gratifying for me if you read my book and continued to developing your music skills. If you ever get your Musical Knowledge skill to rank A, I'll give you another book of mine as well. -Loeiz-
12443	I've heard about your diligent studies in music composition. You must really love music, huh? Hahaha. I myself once took an interest in music, and even composed my own songs. Keep up the good work in practicing compositional skills. If you attain Composition at Rank E, I'll give you some of my blank music books. -Wanst-

12445	It's good to write your own songs. I used to compose when I was young... but as I got older, my songs got better. <p/> I'll give you a blank score, so try hard and keep composing. And then write a song that is suitable for drinking wine to. I will be very willing to listen, of course, with my wine.

12624	... You already knew everything. I won’t deny any of it... But that doesn’t mean my convictions have changed. <p/>... How to restore Kelpie’s memory... There’s no way to tell as of now. The only thing I can tell you... is that the Memory Tower used to manipulate the memory was made in the image of the relic left by Irinid.<p/>Perhaps the answer lies in Zardine, where all of this started.
12625	Well, if you want to learn more about Zardine, then you must first learn about the Gold Dragon. Although, you should keep in mind that legends are legends after all. We may never know just how much truth there is to such stories.<p/> In any case, it is said that the Gold Dragon is born and destroyed every few thousand years. <p/> Some people interpret the legend in symbolic terms, rather than as a physical phenomenon that actually occurs. <p/> But anyway, during its birth, the dragon apparently goes through a process known as the ‘Conduction Ceremony'... <p/>You might call it a moment in which the Dragon becomes one with an existential being of Erinn. <p/> The character of the chosen being, knows as the Conductor, supposedly determines whether the Gold Dragon is to turn evil or grow into a dragon that fights for the good of Erinn. <p/> The birth of a new Gold Dragon and a Conduction Ceremony is scheduled to come to pass. <p/> As the day approaches, the activity of the two rival forces, the Blue Dragon and Red Dragon, have been unusual... <p/> We can’t predict exactly when the scheduled Conduction Ceremony will occur but there have already been strange signs that have been confirmed. Would you like to help me with a few missions? <p/> First, there seems to be a huge disparity of temperature inside the Flints as we approach the Conduction Ceremony. <p/> Could you get me 10 Flints, so that I may analyze them?
12626	Hmm... Judging by the crystal inside the Flints, they seem to be different from their usual state.<br/>But this isn’t enough evidence. <p/>I heard that the animals near the volcanic region have become extremely unsettled recently. Could you help me study these animals? <p/>If you could tame some wild animals, that might just be what we need.	
12627	It has been confirmed that the entire ecosystem of Zardine has been affected by the Conduction Ceremony. <p/> We’re currently drawing up plans to investigate certain regions we think<br/>may be the location in which the Conduction Ceremony might occur. <p/>Unfortunately, those Wyverns have become so aggressive as of late, that it’s become difficult to even launch a Hot-Air Balloon from anywhere in Zardine. <p/>You’re the expert when it comes to such things aren’t you? Could you lend me a hand?

12656	You don’t have to explain what happened at Lava Fall. I already know. <p/>It’s not your fault that you fell into the trap of the wicked Red Dragon, Crumena. Don’t be so hard on yourself. <p/> I don’t know how someone from this world was able to get involved so heavily regarding the fate of the dragon race, but I get the feeling that this, too, must have been fate. <p/> Originally, Iria was ruled by dragons. The arrogance of the dragons brought Irinid to this land and after losing the Irinid war, the dragons were exiled to the barren land of Zardine. Within the barrier drawn by Irinid,<br/>our race decided to endure and accept what can be seen as our punishment. <p/>However, there are those who viewed this way of life for the dragons as feeble and disgraceful. These were the Red Dragons, the ones, who after being defeated at the Irinid War, lost their power and had to walk the path of shame. <p/> Although what they envisioned was a revolution and not peace, it could not be done within the dragon society of Zardine where the Blue Dragons were already in control. But now an opportunity has been given to them. The Gold Dragon, Adniel’s Conduction Ceremony is nearing, and the Red Dragons are planning to use this event for political gain. <p/> Their first move will probably be	<br/>trying to set up a trap for Cromm Cruaich You should know that you, too, were probably used for their scheme. Cromm Cruaich is not only the leader of the Blue Dragons but also the dragon that represents Zardine.<p/> At the time, it was leading the dragon’s contractor, a red-haired Human, to Iria to prepare for the Conduction Ceremony of the Gold Dragon. <p/> Although Cromm Cruaich fell into Lava Fall, the hottest part of Zardine, it’s too early to give up hope yet. Right before Cromm Cruaich died, it was able to protect the dragon’s contractor by using its final protection magic. <p/> I can still feel the red-haired Human breathing.<p/> If you could get your hands on the Physis Snow Crystal, which can break through the scorching heat of Lava Fall, you might still be able to turn back the costly error that you unknowingly made.	
12657	Krug's Expeditionary Team
12658	We can no longer just sit and watch those Elves destroy the Irai Ruins that contain the spirit of the ancient Giants! If you're a Giant or a supporter of Giants, answer my call. - Krug

12661	Speak with Krug
12662	It has been confirmed that the spirit of the ancient Giants has been discovered at the Irai Ruins. With this new discovery, the ownership of the Ruins should rightfully belong to the Giants. <p/> Of course, I expect there to be some confrontation with the Elves during this process. If there is confrontation, we will have no choice but to respond to it. I am thinking of forming an expedition for this very purpose. <p/> If Taunes, the greatest warrior of Vales, leads the way the Elves won't stand a chance... I heard that you and Taunes are quite close. Would you go to Taunes and convince him to take on this mission?
12663	Is he planning to start another meaningless war? I will not partake in this. Either way, my eyesight is getting worse by the day so there's not much I can do...
12664	He's going to reject the King's command!? How could he...? I guess what Kirine said about Taunes was right all along. <p/> This time I can't forgive him. He will pay thoroughly for this!

12691	It's me, Duncan. I wish to tell you a little bit about a traditional game we play here in Erinn. -Duncan-
12692	Talk with Duncan
12693	There's a great traditional game that we play here in Erinn. It's a seesaw game called Jump for the Moon. First, you create a big seesaw using a Seesaw Construction Kit. Next, two people stand atop either end of the seesaw. Then, they jump! <p/> The moment those two people breathe and jump in harmony, they will experience a feeling like no other, like flying through the air! I'll give you a Seesaw Construction Kit to get you started. Give it a try. <p/> You can purchase more kits from the General Shop. Now, go ahead. Try jumping for the moon! If you can jump high enough, perhaps something extraordinary will happen...?

14332	Have you been asked by Tawns?<br/>He sometimes has a very reckless place ...<username/>It would be really dangerous for you to come to such a place ...<p/>… But that's why I might think of him specially …….<br/>Can you tell Tawns that you're fine?<p/>Recently, I've been busy with a lot of tourists coming and going.<br/>It doesn't hurt your body ...
14333	Is Atlata fine without incident?<br/>Fortunately. Thank you for the good news,<username/>..<br/>So let's finish the talk with you first.<p/>This proved that you have devoted yourself.<br/>Qualification is enough to learn the skill "Taunt" to protect allies.<p/>Taunt Skill tries to attack your allies<br/>It's a skill that draws the enemy's attention to you.<br/>It's one of the skills you should learn if you think of your peers.<p/>If you have enough protection, the effect will be multiplied.

14353	It can be said that the essence of the arrow lies in the arrow.<br/>It is no exaggeration to say that the nature of the arrow is determined by this part.<br/>Of course there is a way to adjust the length of the arrow, but<br/>It's a very dangerous act to sacrifice balance.<p/>Recently I'm doing research on yajiri.<br/>If you don't mind, would you please bring me various swords?
14354	Which ... I see ... This amber-like shade of light,<br/>The delicate light that passes through is like a faint sunset ...<br/>Okay, then bring the emerald arrow.
14355	Hard work ... which ... it's an emerald beautiful glow,<br/>Do you know it? Emeralds are said to symbolize hope and stability.<br/>Alright, bring the amethyst arrow at the end.<br/>That completes all the preparations.

Timing to use counter attack,<br/>Was it difficult?<p/>When the mongooses are attacked<br/>I'll run right away and fight back<br/>It's a good partner to practice.<p/>Well ... I think I found out after trying it,<br/>If your opponent mainly uses ranged attacks or magic,<br/>Counter attacks aren't very useful.<br/>You know this, right?<p/>In other words, during battle, according to the opponent's attack pattern,<br/>Which of the skills you have ...<br/>Don't forget that such tactics will also be needed.

14853	Welcome back. how was it?<br/>Isn't it a little difficult to try in close quarters?<br/>Unlike a bow, you attack once ...<br/>Repeating that all the time is the biggest feature of close combat.<p/>However, if you are attacked by the other party as it is, you will not have it, right?<br/>Therefore, what is needed is the basic and defense skills of close combat!<br/>If you use your defense skills before being attacked by your opponent,<br/>You can fight back immediately while minimizing the damage.<p/>Because it is a skill that is often used even when using a bow as the main<br/>I recommend registering it as a shortcut key on the screen and using it.<p/>Oh, you don't have to worry about your skills.<br/>I'll tell you.<br/>good?

16612	Seems like because you are interested, that you came.<br/>I recently researched how to implement the principles of ice mines<br/>to other things.<p/>However, it has not achieved the desired effect.<br/>Can you help me find unknown ore fragments?<br/>I used ice mines with the research, using the unknown ore fragments to craft the ice mines.<p/>We should be able to see the results of my research soon.
16613	You really helped me by finding it!<br/>Was it difficult to find? Thank you so much!<p/>Can you wait for me here?<br/>I want to study it a bit.<p/>...<p/>...<p/>...<p/>Come here and look!<br/>Using this method<br/>we can use the strength of magic with our arrow heads.<p/>How should we name this principle?<p/>We only have a short time to use it,<br/>Besides, the magic can only be transferred from the stove, which makes it unusable...<p/>I have the formula here. Please take it to Tir Chonaill's Lassar.<br/>It could possibly work with the power of magic.
16614	You said that Dorren had you bring this over?<br/>Show me the formula.<p/>Oh, this alchemic method<br/>might have unwanted effects.<br/>So long as it does not require the stove, but using something else, it works?<p/>If that's how it is, we can achieve results quickly.<p/>Although, recently at Ciar Dungeon<br/>there seems to be Laghodessas.<p/>Others have also reported seeing them outside the dungeon.<br/>I'm not sure if that is true, but there seems to be a larger population.<br/>I'm going to stay here and continue reseaching the formula！ Go check out the dungeon in my stead.
16615	Did you really kill the Laghodessa that quickly?<br/>Wow...You really are exceptional.<p/>Though, I'm not that inferior to you, as I have studied the formula well.<br/>Ok...<p/>The fourth line of this method<br/>is used with the bow.<p/>When the arrow strikes its target<br/>it will also identify surrounding targets.<br/>Then, the arrow will strike the target and explode<br/>and the explosion will create debris striking the surrounding enemies.<p/>Remember<br/>it should be used where there are many enemies gathered.
